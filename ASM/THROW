* THIS IS A KLUDGEY INTERFACE TO THE ZILTHROW ROUTINE, PENDING        *
* DIRECT SUPPORT IN THE COMPILER FOR THROW.                           *

* This routine is actually obsolete, and does not belong in ZIL,      *
* since THROW is a special form.  However, it is kept around for      *
* compatibility - more accurately, to permit the relinking of code    *
* that was compiled by ZIL when THROW was a function.  THROW was      *
* changed to a special form because of multiple values.               *
*                                                                     *
