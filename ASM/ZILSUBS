* THIS MODULE IS LINKEDITED WITH THE SUBROUTINES INDICATED HEREIN BY  *
* V-CON'S, WHICH ARE THE SUBROUTINES TO BE DYNAMICALLY LOADED BY      *
* ZILINIT AT INITIALIZATION TIME AND WHOSE ADDRESSES ARE TO BE PLACED *
* IN THE COMMON AREA.  ROUTINES WHICH REQUIRE THESE SUBROUTINES WILL  *
* CALL THEM BY RETRIEVING THEIR ADDRESSES OUT OF COMMON RATHER THAN   *
* HAVING THEM LINKEDITED WITH THE LOAD MODULES.                       *
* THE REASONS FOR PLACING MODULES IN HERE VARY, BUT THEY INCLUDE      *
* ESTABLISHING STANDARD (AND POSSIBLY VARYING OVER TIME) INTERFACES   *
* WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE FULL-FLEDGED MODULES TO BE CODED, OR TO        *
* PROVIDE EXPEDITED INTERFACES TO COMMONLY INVOKED FUNCTIONS.  THE    *
* INTERPRETER/EVALUATOR SUPPORT CODE ALSO WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE.    *
*                                                                     *
* THIS MODULE IS NOT EXECUTABLE, ALTHOUGH ITS EXTERNAL ROUTINES ARE.  *
*                                                                     *
