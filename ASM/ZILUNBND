* ZILUNBND TAKES NO ARGUMENTS.                                        *
*                                                                     *
* THIS FUNCTION RETURNS THE OBJECT "ZLCUNBND", A SPECIAL ENTITY THAT  *
* REPRESENTS AN "UNBOUND" VARIABLE VALUE.
*                                                                     *
* MAKUNBOUND INSERTS THIS VALUE INTO THE CDR OF A BINDING CELL.       *
* ZEVSYM CHECKS FOR THIS VALUE AND RETURNS NIL INSTEAD OF A BINDING   *
* THAT CONTAINS THIS VALUE.                                           *
* COMPILED CODE HAS BUILT-IN REFERENCES TO THIS OBJECT.               *
*                                                                     *
* AN ATTEMPT TO PRINT THIS OBJECT WILL BE DISASTROUS.                 *
*                                                                     *
* THIS MODULE USES NO STACK SPACE AND SAVES NO REGISTERS.             *
*                                                                     *

* Note:  Presumably this will be obsoleted by shallow binding.        *
*        A shallow binding implementation will set the value cell of  *
*        a symbol to a different "unbound" marker, which has the      *
*        high-order bit turned on to facilitate compiled code checks. *
*                                                                     *
