* ZCPRINT is the ZIL "current printer", called by PRINC, PRIN1,       *
*    CTERPRI, TERPRI and TYO.                                         *

* arg 1 = the object to be printed, if applicable.                    *
* arg 2 = the file to print it on.                                    *
* arg 3 = a fixnum built from the following boolean values:           *
*                                                                     *

* ZCPRINT is very simple: it merely passes its arguments to the       *
* function whose address is in the common area field ZLCCPRT,         *
* which is the compiled (or assembled) ZIL function which is          *
* currently doing the printing.  That function is initialized         *
* to ZDPRINT (the DEFAULT ZIL printer), but any compiled function     *
* that processes its arguments similarly may have its address         *
* inserted into that field to become the current ZIL printer.         *
*                                                                     *
