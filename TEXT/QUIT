Function: QUIT

Syntax:   (QUIT &optional arg1)

 arg1 (optional, evaluated) - an input file name.

Returns:

 NIL; end-of-file status is forced on the file specified by arg1.

Processing:

 A flag is set on in the file block for the input file specified by arg1
 so that subsequent input functions (READ, READCH, etc.)  receive an
 end-of-file indication.  Subsequent processing is dependent upon the
 program structure.

 If the argument is NIL or is omitted (same thing), end-of-file is
 forced upon standard input.  This is one way of terminating the ZIL
 interpreter, which reads, evaluates, and prints the values of forms
 from the standard input file until end-of-file is encountered.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid input file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified input file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 Invoked from within a LISP function (compiled or interpreted)
 running under the interpreter, (QUIT) or (QUIT NIL) causes the
 interpreter to shut down cleanly and terminate.  Compare EXIT,
 which terminates the interpreter unkindly by forcing return to the
 operating system.

 You can also use (END), which is not a function but indicates end of
 input to READ-EVAL-PRINT or to the compiler.

Examples:

 (QUIT)
 (QUIT NIL)   ...are equivalent.

 (QUIT 'FOO)     forces end-of-file on the input file FOO.
