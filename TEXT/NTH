Function: NTH

Syntax:   (NTH arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 The "n'th" element of the list specified by arg2, where arg1 selects
 which element, counting from zero.

Processing:

 If arg1 is greater than or equal to the length of the list specified by
 arg2, NIL is returned.  Otherwise the "nth" CAR of the list is
 returned, as follows:

  (NTH 0 list) is equivalent to (CAR list),
  (NTH 1 list) is equivalent to (CADR list),
  etc.

Errors signaled:

 First argument not a fixnum, or is negative.
 Second argument not a proper list or NIL.

Notes:

 Although (NTH 0 list) is equivalent to (CAR list), it is not as
 efficient since the first argument is always evaluated arithmetically.

Examples:

 (NTH 0 '(A B C))         ==> A
 (NTH 1 '(A B C))         ==> B
 (NTH 2 '(A B C))         ==> C
 (NTH 3 '(A B C))         ==> NIL
 (NTH 4 '(A B C))         ==> NIL
