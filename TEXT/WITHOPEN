Macro: WITH-OPEN-FILE

Syntax:   (WITH-OPEN-FILE (filevar dsn &optional options) &rest body)

 filevar - a symbol that can be used as a lambda list variable.
 dsn     - a data set name (string or symbol).
 options - a value to be passed to OPEN.
 body    - zero or more forms to be executed.

Returns:

 The value returned by the last of the body forms, with the variable
 speified by filevar being bound to the file returned by opening dsn.

Processing:

 WITH-OPEN-FILE opens dsn for the access type specified by options,
 binding filevar to the file returned by OPEN.  It then evaluates
 all the forms in body under this binding, closes the file, and
 returns the last value from the body.  It insures (via UNWIND-PROTECT)
 that the file is closed no matter what happens during executing of
 the body (THROW, errors, etc.).

Errors signaled:

 None signalled by macro expansion, but...

Notes:

 Because WITH-OPEN-FILE is a binding form, declarations are permitted
 at the beginning of the body.  Thus, for example, the variable
 specified by filevar can be declared SPECIAL if desired.

Examples:

 (when (null (prefix))
       (tso ("profile prefix(" (userid) ")"))
       nil)                          ==> NIL

 (with-open-file (f "foo.temp" 'out)
  (format f "~&(a list of stuff)~%")
  'TRY-IT
 )                                     ==> TRY-IT

 (with-open-file (f "foo.temp")
  (read f)
 )                                     ==> (A LIST OF STUFF)
