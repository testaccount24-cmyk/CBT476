Function: PROBEF

Syntax:   (PROBEF arg1)
    or:   (PROBE-FILE arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a string representing a data set name.

Returns:

 A string containing the data set name represented by arg1 if it
 names a valid and existing data set name, else NIL.

Processing:

 PROBEF invokes OPEN with the PROBE option to see if the data set
 specified by arg1 exists.  If it does, a copy of arg1 is returned
 which is (at least currently) arg1 uppercased; otherwise NIL is
 returned.

 A message is also issued that the data set is not found, which can
 be suppressed only via (MSGLEVEL 3) (not recommended).  To avoid
 seeing this message, you might wish to use (OPEN arg1 'PROBE)
 directly.

Errors signaled:

 See OPEN.

Notes:

Examples:

 (when (null (prefix))
       (tso ("profile prefix(" (userid) ")"))
       nil)                          ==> NIL

 (PROBEF "'csd.cmd.clist(xsetup)'")  ==> "'CSD.CMD.CLIST(XSETUP)'"

 (PROBEF "'csd.cmd.clist(junk)'")  ==> NIL

 (PROBEF "Â¬&*()_")  ==>  NIL   ; Syntax errors are considered bad dsns.

 (PROBEF "cmd.clist")   ==>("***ERROR***"); Still considered an error.
