Function: REMPROP

Syntax:   (REMPROP arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally a symbol.

Returns:

 The value of the property specified by the second argument, as taken
 and removed from the property list specified by the first argument.
 If the property was not present, NIL is returned and the property
 list is unharmed.

Processing:

 The indicator/value pair for the property specified by the second
 argument is removed from the property list of the atom specified
 by the first argument.

 Although the first argument must be a symbol, ZIL will accept a
 first argument of a list, in which case the CDR of the list is
 treated like a property list.  This is the "disembodied property list"
 used in Maclisp.

Errors signaled:

 Property list errors (see member $PROP).

Notes:

 See member $PROP for information about property lists.

Examples:

 (SETPLIST 'A '(FOO BAR BAZ (FROB NICK ATE)))
                         ==> A
 (GET 'A 'FOO)           ==> BAR
 (GET 'A 'BAZ)           ==> (FROB NICK ATE)

 (REMPROP 'A 'FOO)       ==> BAR
 (GET 'A 'FOO)           ==> NIL
 (GET 'A 'BAZ)           ==> (FROB NICK ATE)

 (REMPROP 'A 'BAZ)       ==> (FROB NICK ATE)
 (GET 'A 'FOO)           ==> NIL
 (GET 'A 'BAZ)           ==> NIL

 (REMPROP 'A 'FOO)       ==> NIL
 (GET 'A 'FOO)           ==> NIL
 (GET 'A 'BAZ)           ==> NIL
