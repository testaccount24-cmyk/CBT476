Macro: SIGNP

Syntax:   (SIGNP arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, not evaluated) - L, LE, E, N, GE, or G.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg2 is numeric and satisfies the test specified by arg1,
 else NIL.

Processing:

 If arg2 is numeric AND the following test holds, T is returned:

 Value of arg1        Test
 -------------        ----
  L                    arg2 <  0
  LE                   arg2 <= 0
  E                    arg2 =  0
  N                    arg2 /= 0
  GE                   arg2 >= 0
  G                    arg2 >  0

 Remember that arg1 is NOT evaluated, but arg2 IS.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 This is a Maclisp facility that even Maclisp programmers don't use.
 It is required by Macsyma.
