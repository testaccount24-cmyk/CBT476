Function: MAKE-VECTOR

Syntax:   (MAKE-VECTOR arg1 &optional arg2)
    or:   (MKVECTOR arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 A vector of (n) elements, where n is the value of arg1, and all of
 the elements are arg2.

Processing:

 A vector is allocated with the number of elements specified by arg1,   urned
 which must be a fixnum.  All of the elements are initialized to arg2,
 which defaults to NIL.

 A zero length is valid, in which case the vector has no elements.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a fixnum.
 Not enough vector space to build the vector, even after GC;
 or vector length is negative.

Notes:

 MAKE-VECTOR and MKVECTOR are equivalent and both acceptable names.

Examples:

 (MAKE-VECTOR 0)   ==> #()
 (MAKE-VECTOR 1)   ==> #(NIL)
 (MAKE-VECTOR 5)   ==> #(NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)
 (MAKE-VECTOR 5 "foo") ==> #("foo" "foo" "foo" "foo" "foo")
