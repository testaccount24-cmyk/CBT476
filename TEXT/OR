Special Form: OR

Syntax:   (OR &rest args)

 arg (conditionally evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The first non-NIL argument specified; NIL if there is no such arg.

Processing:

 Each argument in succession is evaluated until one of them returns a
 value other than NIL; if so, evaluation of the following arguments
 is bypassed.  This is known as "short-circuit" evaluation.

 OR with no arguments returns NIL, by definition.

 OR may be used as a mini-conditional, e.g.:

  (OR condition1 result) is equivalent to
                                   (IF (NOT condition1) THEN result).
  (OR cond1 cond2 ... condn result) is equivalent to
                   (IF (NOT (OR cond1 cond2 ... condn)) THEN result).

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

Examples:

 (OR)                    ==> NIL
 (OR 'A 'B 'C)           ==> A
 (OR NIL 'B 'C)          ==> B
 (OR NIL NIL NIL)        ==> NIL
 (OR (EQ 'A 'A) 'FALSE)  ==> T
 (OR (EQ 'A 'B) 'TRUE)   ==> TRUE
