Function: GETL

Syntax:   (GETL arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a list.

Returns:

 The sublist of the property list of arg1 whose CAR is a property
 indicator EQ to one of the elements of arg2, or NIL if no such
 indicator exists.

Processing:

 The property list of the atom specified by arg1 is searched for an
 indicator-value "pair" for which the indicator is EQ to one of the
 elements of arg2.

 If such a property is present, the sublist of the property list is
 returned; the CAR of this list is the indicator found, and the CADR
 (second element) is the property value.

 If the specified property is not present on the property list, NIL is
 returned.

 The first matching property indicator in the property list determines
 the return value; the order of the elements in arg2 is irrelevant.

 Although the first argument must be a symbol, ZIL will accept a
 first argument of a list, in which case the CDR of the list is
 treated like a property list.  This is the "disembodied property list"
 used in Maclisp.

 If the first argument is not a symbol or a list, a warning message
 is issued and NIL is returned.  This actually should be an error,
 but is accepted for compatibility with Maclisp.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid property list (not a proper list or NIL).

Notes:

 A property list has the following format:

  (indicator1 value1 indicator2 value2 ...)

 where (GETL atom indicator1) returns "value1", etc.

Examples:

 (SETPLIST 'A NIL)                   ==> A
 (GETL 'A '(FOO BAR))                ==> NIL
 (SETPLIST 'A '(FOO BAR BAZ (FROB NICK ATE)))
                                     ==> A
 (GETL 'A '(FOO BAR BAZ))            ==> (FOO BAR BAZ (FROB NICK ATE))
 (GETL 'A '(BAZ FOO BAR))            ==> (FOO BAR BAZ (FROB NICK ATE))
 (GETL 'A '(BAZ))                    ==> (BAZ (FROB NICK ATE))
 (GETL 'A '(BAR FROB))               ==> NIL

;The comparison test is EQ, not EQUAL or EQUALP.

 (SETF (PLIST 'A) '(1.0 X))          ==> (1.0 X)
 (GETL 'A '(1.0 2.0 3.0))            ==> NIL
