 The following are the special forms in Zil:

     AND
     ARG
     BLOCK
     CATCH
     COND
     DECLARE
     DEFLOAD
     DEFUN
     DEFVAR
     EVAL-WHEN
     FUNCTION
     GO
     LISTIFY
     MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND
     MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST
     OR
     PROGN
     QUOTE
     RETURN-FROM
     SETARG
     SETQ
     SUBR
     TAGBODY
     THROW
     UNWIND-PROTECT

 Note that PROG and RETURN, which used to be special forms, are
 now macros.

 Not all of these are special forms in Common Lisp.  Also, some
 Common Lisp special forms are implemented as macros in Zil.
 For this reason, it is more accurate to call Zil "Common Lisp
 compatible" than a Common Lisp implementation, if strict legality
 is at stake.  This may change in the future.
