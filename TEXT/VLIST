Function: VLIST

Syntax:   (VLIST arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a vector-type object.

Returns:

 A list containing the elements of the vector specified by arg1.

Processing:

 A list is built by repeated CONSing of the elements of arg1.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a vector-type object (does not satisfy VECP).

Notes:

 A "vector-type object" is an object composed of contiguous instances
 of other LISP objects.  In ZIL, vectors, structures and funargs
 (interpreted lexical closures) are vector-type objects that satisfy
 the predicate VECP.

Examples:

 (VLIST #(FOO BAR BAZ))  ==> (FOO BAR BAZ)
 (VLIST #())             ==> NIL
 (VLIST (MKVECTOR 10))   ==> (NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)
 (VLIST (STRUCTURE 'A 'B 'C)) ==> (A B C)
