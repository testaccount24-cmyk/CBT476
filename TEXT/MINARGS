Function: MINARGS

Syntax:   (MINARGS arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a compiled code object (SUBR or closure).

Returns:

 A fixnum specifying the minimum number of arguments that can be
 passed to the specified compiled code object.

Processing:

 MINARGS looks at the compiled code header information, extracts the
 minimum number of arguments therefrom, and builds a fixnum containing
 the value.

 Two ways to specify compiled code objects are:

 (1) (GET function-name 'SUBR) - which gets the current function
     definition provided that it has been loaded.
 (2) (ZILLOAD function-name)   - which loads the function from disk.

 See also MAXARGS.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a compiled code object or closure.

Notes:

 This function was formerly used by the evaluator, but is now useless.
 It has been retained because someone somewhere might find it useful.
 In particular, the ARGS function uses this internally.

Examples:

 (PRINT (CAR NIL))              ==> NIL ; to load CAR and PRINT.
 (MINARGS (GET 'CAR 'SUBR))     ==> 1   ; after CAR has been used.
 (MINARGS (ZILLOAD 'GC))        ==> 0
 (MINARGS (GET 'PRINT 'SUBR))   ==> 1   ; after PRINT has been used.
 (MINARGS (ZILLOAD 'READCH))    ==> 0
