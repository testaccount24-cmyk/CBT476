Function: FLOOR

Syntax:   (FLOOR arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a number.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 Two values:

  (1) arg1, or arg1 divided by arg2, converted to an integer.
  (2) If arg1 only is specified, the difference of arg1 and the
      first value.
      If arg1 and arg2 are specified, the remainder, i.e. the difference
      of arg1 and (arg2 times the first value).

Processing:

 If arg2 is specified, arg1 is divided by arg2 such that a floating
 point result is obtained.  Otherwise, the argument is set to arg1.

 If the argument is float, the nearest integer less than or equal to
 the argument is returned.

 If the argument is integer, itself is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument.

Notes:

 Compare ROUND, which rounds its argument to the nearest integer;
 CEILING, which returns the nearest integer greater than or equal to its
 argument; and TRUNCATE, which returns the integer part of the flonum.
 FIX is identical to FLOOR in ZIL 1.3.

 Note that flonums whose exponent is large (in either direction) may
 result in integers whose value does not accurately represent the
 integer part of the flonum.

 ; Note: Only the first value is shown in these examples.
