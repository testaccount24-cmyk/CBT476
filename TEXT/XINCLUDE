Function: XINCLUDE

Syntax:   (XINCLUDE dsn1)

 dsn1  (required, not evaluated) - a data set name (string or symbol).

Returns:

 A list comprising the atom PROGN and all the forms in the dataset
 specified by dsn1, with NIL as the last element.

Processing:

 All the forms from the data set specified by dsn1 are read and
 collected (without evaluation) into a PROGN form with NIL as the
 last value.  If this form is evaluated, it should produce the
 same result as loading the original dsn1.

 READ errors do not terminate the operation.

Errors signaled:

 Errors detected by OPEN and READ.

Notes:

 XINCLUDE is the function that underlies the INCLUDE and INCLUDEF
 macros (q.v.).  Direct use of XINCLUDE is not recommended but may
 be useful under certain circumstances.
