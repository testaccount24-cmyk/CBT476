Function: PUTPROP

Syntax:   (PUTPROP arg1 arg2 arg3)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 arg3 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally a symbol.

Returns:

 arg2, after it has been made the value of the property specified by
 arg3 on the property list of the atom specified by arg1.

Processing:

 Herein, arg1 is the atom whose property list is being manipulated;
 arg2 is the property value being assigned, and arg3 is the name of
 the property (the indicator).

 If arg3 is already an indicator on the property list of arg1,
 then the current value of the arg3 property is (destructively)
 replaced by arg2.  Otherwise, the indicator/value "pair" consisting
 of arg2 and arg3 is added (CONS'ed) to the beginning of the
 property list of arg1.

 Specifying NIL as arg2 is equivalent to doing (REMPROP arg1 arg3),
 except that REMPROP actually splices the indicator/value pair out
 of the property list whereas PUTPROP merely replaces the value
 with NIL.

 Although arg1 must be a symbol, ZIL will accept a first argument of a
 list, in which case the CDR of the list is treated like a property
 list.  This is the "disembodied property list" used in Maclisp.

Errors signaled:

 Property list errors (see member $PROP).

Notes:

 See member $PROP for information about property lists.
