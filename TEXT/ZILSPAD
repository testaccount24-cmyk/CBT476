Function: ZILSPAD

Syntax:   (ZILSPAD str1 len2 pad3 arg4 arg5)

 str1 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 len2 (required, evaluated) - a non-negative fixnum.
 pad3 (required, evaluated) - a character (either a string of length 1
                                        or a fixnum between 0 and 255).
 arg4 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.
 arg5 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum, generally 1, 0 or -1.

Returns:

 A string containing the contents of str1 padded (using the character
 pad3) to the length of len2.

Processing:

 A string of length len2 is returned (unless arg4 is NIL and len2
 is less than the length of string str1, in which case a string of
 the same length as str1 is returned).  The string contains the
 text of str1, padded out to the length len2 using pad3 as the
 pad character.

 If arg4 is NIL, no truncation is done; the minimum length of the
 returned string will be the length of str1.

 If arg4 is non-NIL, truncation will be done; if len2 is less than
 the length of str1, a string containing only the first len2
 characters of str1 will be returned.

 arg5 determines how the padding will be done, as follows:

  If arg5 is positive, the padding will be done on the right.  In
  other words, the text will be left justified.

  If arg5 is negative, the padding will be done on the left.  In
  other words, the text will be right justified.

  If arg5 is zero, the padding will be done on both sides.  In
  other words, the text will be centered.

Errors signaled:

 str1 not a string.
 len2 not a valid length.
 pad3 not a valid character.

Notes:

 As for many functions that take strings as arguments, symbols are
 permitted; their print names are used in that case.  However, this
 function always returns a string.

Examples:

 (ZILSPAD "foo" 10 " " NIL  1)    ==> "foo       "
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 10 " " NIL  0)    ==> "   foo    "
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 10 " " NIL -1)    ==> "       foo"
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 10 " " T    1)    ==> "foo       "
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 10 " " T    0)    ==> "   foo    "
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 10 " " T   -1)    ==> "       foo"

 (ZILSPAD "foo" 1 " " NIL  1)     ==> "foo"
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 1 " " NIL  0)     ==> "foo"
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 1 " " NIL -1)     ==> "foo"
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 1 " " T    1)     ==> "f"
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 1 " " T    0)     ==> "f"
 (ZILSPAD "foo" 1 " " T   -1)     ==> "f"

 (ZILSPAD 'something 20 "-" NIL 1) ==> "SOMETHING-----------"
 (ZILSPAD 'something 20 #/a NIL 1) ==> "SOMETHINGaaaaaaaaaaa"
 (ZILSPAD ""         20 #/z NIL 1) ==> "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
