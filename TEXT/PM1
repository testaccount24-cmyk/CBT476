Function: PM1

Syntax:   (PM1 arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a LISP object.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - a file name.

Returns:

 No values, after the macro expansion of the form specified by arg1 is
 pretty-printed on the file specified by arg2.

Processing:

 arg1 is macroexpanded by MACROEXPAND-1 and then pretty-printed.  The
 default file is the standard output file.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 This function exists purely for the convenience of the ZIL developer.

 See PPRINT, MEXPAND and PP for more details.

 Compare PM, which is like PM1 but uses MACROEXPAND.

Examples:

 (PM1 '(IF A B C))

  causes the following to be printed on the standard output file:

 (COND (A B)
       (T C))
