Special Form: PROGN

Syntax:   (PROGN &rest args)

 arg (evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The last of the arguments.

Processing:

 Each argument is evaluated in turn; since the values of all
 arguments but the last are not used, these are generally
 specified for their effects only.  When the last argument is
 evaluated, its value is returned.

 If there are no arguments, PROGN returns NIL.

 In compiled code, PROGN signifies a series of forms to be
 processed as "top-level" forms.  See $COMPILE for more information.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The format (PROGN 'COMPILE ...) used to be the traditional way to
 signal a series of top-level forms to the compiler; it is no longer
 necessary since PROGN always does this without the 'COMPILE.  See
 $COMPILE for more information.

Examples:

 (PROGN)                          ==> NIL
 (PROGN 'A)                       ==> A
 (PROGN 'A 'B)                    ==> B
 (PROGN 'A 'B 'C)                 ==> C
 (PROGN (SETQ X '(A B)) (CAR X))  ==> A
