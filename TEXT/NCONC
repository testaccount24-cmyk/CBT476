Function: NCONC

Syntax:   (NCONC &rest lists)

 list (optional, evaluated) - a list
                             (although the last argument need not be).

Returns:

 A list consisting of all the elements (CAR's) of all the arguments
 combined into one list.

Processing:

 All arguments except the last are destructively altered.  Each
 argument is RPLACD'd onto the last CAR of the preceding argument.

 (NCONC) (with no arguments) returns NIL.

 (NCONC list) returns "list", unaltered.

 If the first argument is NIL, NCONC of the remainder of the list is
 returned.

 Compare APPEND, which makes copies of its arguments (except for the
 last one, of course).

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a proper list.

Notes:

 As with all the "destructive" functions, NCONC should not be used
 on an in-line compiled list, i.e. a list derived from compiling the
 construct (QUOTE (form1 form2 ...)).  This will cause further
 references to the in-line constant list to be incorrect.

 Do not depend upon NCONC's altering of the first argument if the
 first argument may be NIL.  Use SETQ to insure updating of the
 first argument, as follows:

  (SETQ X (NCONC X Y))

Examples:

 (NCONC)                     ==> NIL
 (NCONC '(A B C))            ==> (A B C)
 (NCONC '(A B C) '(D E F))   ==> (A B C D E F)

;The following shows how the list is altered by NCONC.

 (SETQ X '(A))               ==> (A)
 (SETQ Y '(B C))             ==> (B C)
 (SETQ Z '(D E F))           ==> (D E F)
 (SETQ W (NCONC X Y Z))      ==> (A B C D E F)
 X                           ==> (A B C D E F)
 Y                           ==> (B C D E F)
 Z                           ==> (D E F)
 (EQ X W)                    ==> T
