Function: ZILDSNI

Syntax:   (ZILDSNI file1)

 file1 (required, evaluated) - a file name.

Returns:

 A string containing the actual data set name (and member name, if any)
 to which the input file file1 is allocated.

Processing:

 A string is built as follows:  If file1 is a terminal file (i.e.
 allocated to the terminal or associated with the terminal by default),
 the string "*" is returned.  Otherwise file1 is accessed as an input
 file, and opened if not already open, and the data set name and the
 member name (if any) are retrieved from the JFCB for the file.
 Trailing blanks are removed from both the dsname and the member, and
 parentheses are included in the name if a member is present.  Single
 quotes are NOT included.

Errors signaled:

 file1 not a valid input file name.
 file1 is not open (this can't happen, can it?).
 Not enough vector/string space to return string.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 Because an MVS file (ddname) allocation remains around even after
 the file is closed under ZIL, issuing ZILDSNI against a closed
 input file will cause the file to be reopened.

Examples:

 (ZILDSNI NIL)   will normally return "*".
 (ZILDSNI (OPEN "foo.bar"))  will return "ABC1234.FOO.BAR".
 (ZILDSNI (OPEN "'foo.bar'"))  will return "FOO.BAR".
 (ZILDSNI (OPEN "'foo.bar(baz)'"))  will return "FOO.BAR(BAZ)".
