Function: FMAKUNBOUND

Syntax:   (FMAKUNBOUND arg1)
    or:   (FMAKUNBO    arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 arg1, after removing the current function or macro definition
 therefrom.

Processing:

 Any MACRO, EXPR, FEXPR or SUBR definition currently associated with
 arg1 is removed.

 Note that if the function had or can have a SUBR definition, the
 next reference to that name as a function may cause it to become
 defined as a function again.

 Note that special forms cannot be FMAKUNBOUND'ed.

Errors signaled:

 Arg not a symbol.
 Arg names a special form (it is illegal to "undefine" these).

Notes:

 FMAKUNBOUND does not remove AUTOLOAD properties.  (Maybe it should.)

 Remember that the argument to FMAKUNBOUND is evaluated.

Examples:

 (DEFUN FOO! (X) NIL)   ==> FOO!
 (FBOUNDP 'FOO!)        ==> T
 (FMAKUNBOUND 'FOO!)    ==> FOO!
 (FBOUNDP 'FOO!)        ==> NIL

 (FMAKUNBOUND 'COND)    ==> ("***ERROR***") ; Cannot undefine ...
 (FBOUNDP 'COND)        ==> T    ; Special forms cannot be killed.

 (FMAKUNBOUND 'CAR)     ==> CAR
 (FBOUNDP 'CAR)         ==> T    ; SUBR definition just gets reloaded.
