Special Form: AND

Syntax:   (AND &rest args)

 arg (optional, conditionally evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 NIL if any of the arguments is NIL, else the last argument specified.

Processing:

 Each argument in succession is evaluated until one of them returns
 NIL; if so, evaluation of the following arguments is bypassed.
 This is known as "short-circuit" evaluation.

 AND with no arguments returns T, by definition.

 AND may be used as a mini-conditional, e.g.:

  (AND condition1 result) is equivalent to (IF condition1 THEN result).
  (AND cond1 cond2 ... condn result) is equivalent to
                         (IF (AND cond1 cond2 ... condn) THEN result).

Errors signaled:

 None.

Examples:

 (AND)                   ==> T
 (AND 'A 'B 'C)          ==> C
 (AND 'A NIL 'C)         ==> NIL
 (AND (EQ 'A 'A) 'TRUE)  ==> TRUE
 (AND (EQ 'A 'B) 'FALSE) ==> NIL
