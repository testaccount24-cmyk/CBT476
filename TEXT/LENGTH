Function: LENGTH

Syntax:   (LENGTH arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 An integer containing the number of elements (CAR's) in the list
 specified by arg1.

Processing:

 The elements of the list are counted and an integer is returned
 containing the total count.  This function does not count all
 atomic elements, only the first-level CAR's.

 A dotted pair, a list ending in a dotted pair, or an atom other
 than NIL is invalid and will cause an error to be signalled.
 The length of NIL is zero.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a proper list (see above).

Notes:

 The LENGTH function will loop infinitely on circular lists.

Examples:

 (LENGTH NIL)                ==> 0
 (LENGTH '(A))               ==> 1
 (LENGTH '(A B C))           ==> 3
 (LENGTH '((A B) C))         ==> 2
 (LENGTH '((A B) (C D)))     ==> 2
