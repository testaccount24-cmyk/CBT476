Function: SYMEVAL

Syntax:   (SYMEVAL arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 The current dynamic (special) value of the symbol arg1.

Processing:

 Remember that arg1 is evaluated.

 arg1 must be a symbol other than T, NIL or a keyword.

 The current global or dynamic "SPECIAL" binding for the symbol is
 located and the value, if one exists, is returned.
 (Symbol autoloading may be invoked if there is an AUTOVALUE
 property on the symbol and it does not currently have a
 dynamically bound value.)

Errors signaled:

 Variable has no value (either because there is no binding or
 because the binding has no value).

Notes:

 SYMEVAL is not a substitute for EVAL.  Use is not encouraged.

 Do not pass T, NIL, or a keyword (symbol beginning with ":") to
 SYMEVAL.

 The old optional "alist" argument to SYMEVAL is no longer supported.
 SYMEVAL cannot be used to access lexical bindings.

 No error checking is done in SYMEVAL.  Use EVAL if you
 are not sure whether an object to be evaluated is a symbol or not.
 Unpredictable results will occur if arg1 is not a symbol.

Examples:

 (MAKUNBOUND 'FOO)                     ==> FOO
 (MAKUNBOUND 'BAZ)                     ==> BAZ
 (DEFVAR FOO 'BAR)                     ==> FOO
 FOO                                   ==> BAR
 (SYMEVAL 'FOO)                        ==> BAR
 (SYMEVAL 'BAZ)                        ==> ("***ERROR***")
                                       ; Error - unbound variable.
 (MAKUNBOUND 'A)                       ==> A
 A                                     ==> ("***ERROR***")
                                       ; Error - unbound variable.
 (SYMEVAL 'A)                          ==> ("***ERROR***")
                                       ; Error - unbound variable.
 (LET ((A 'NEW-VALUE-OF-A))            ; Local lexical binding.
      (SYMEVAL 'A))                    ==> ("***ERROR***")
                                       ; Error - unbound variable.
 (LET ((A 'NEW-VALUE-OF-A))
      (DECLARE (SPECIAL A))
      (SYMEVAL 'A))                    ==> NEW-VALUE-OF-A
 (SYMEVAL 'A)                          ==> ("***ERROR***")
                                       ; Error - unbound variable.
