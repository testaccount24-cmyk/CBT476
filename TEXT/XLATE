Function: STRING-TRANSLATE

Syntax:   (STRING-TRANSLATE str1 bag2 bag3)
    or:   (XLATE str1 bag2 bag3)

 str1 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 bag2 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 bag3 (required, evaluated) - a string.

Returns:

 A string identical to string1, except that all characters occurring
 in bag3 are replaced with their equivalents in bag2, respectively.

Processing:

 The input argument is not altered.

 As with most string-handling functions, symbols are acceptable.
 However, the returned value is always a string.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid first, second or third argument (not a string).
 Lengths of second and third arguments do not match.
 Insufficient vector/string space to build the result.

Notes:

 This function is patterned after the PL/1 TRANSLATE built-in function.

Examples:

 (STRING-TRANSLATE "foobar" "u" "o")   ==> "fuubar"
 (STRING-TRANSLATE "Oobar" "Za" "Oo")  ==> "Zabar" ; watch out for case!
