Function: STRING-SUBSTR

Syntax: (STRING-SUBSTR string1 index2 &optional length3)
    or:        (SUBSTR string1 index2 &optional length3)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 index2  (optional, evaluated) - a fixnum or NIL.
 length3 (optional, evaluated) - a fixnum or NIL.

Returns:

 A copy of a substring of string1, starting at the character at
 position index2 for a length of length3 (or up to the end if
 length3 is omitted).

Processing:

 One-based indexing is used.

 If length3 is NIL or omitted, the default value is used as
 explained below.

 If index2 is NIL, the null string is returned.  This exists to
 facilitate the use of SUBSTR in conjunction with other string
 functions like INDEX, which may return either a fixnum or NIL.

 If index2 is positive, (length3) characters of string1 starting at
 position index2 from the beginning are made into a string.
 length3 defaults to the length of the string from index2 to the end.

 If index2 is negative, (length3) characters of string1 starting at
 position index2 from the end are made into a string.
 length3 defaults to the length of the string from index2 to the end.

 If the requested length exceeds the bounds of the string, the portion
 up to the end of the string is returned - i.e. the requested length
 is adjusted to stay within the confines of the string.  If the
 requested length is zero, a null string is returned, provided that
 index2 is valid.

 If index2 is zero, length3 is negative, or the absolute value of
 index2 is greater than the length of string1, the null string is
 returned.

 As with most string-handling functions, symbols are acceptable.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid first argument (not a string).
 Invalid second argument (not a fixnum or NIL).
 Invalid third argument (not a fixnum or NIL).

Notes:

 This function is analogous to the PL/1 SUBSTR function, and is most
 nearly similar to Franz LISP SUBSTRING (in its use of negative values).
 Other implementations of LISP interpret the third argument to similar
 functions differently.

Examples:

 (SUBSTR "frob" -5)        ==> ""
 (SUBSTR "frob" -4)        ==> "frob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" -3)        ==> "rob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" -2)        ==> "ob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" -1)        ==> "b"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 0)         ==> ""
 (SUBSTR "frob" 1)         ==> "frob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 2)         ==> "rob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 3)         ==> "ob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 4)         ==> "b"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 5)         ==> ""

 (SUBSTR "frob" NIL)       ==> ""

 (SUBSTR "frob" 1 2)       ==> "fr"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 2 4)       ==> "rob"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 3 1)       ==> "o"
 (SUBSTR "frob" 2 0)       ==> ""
