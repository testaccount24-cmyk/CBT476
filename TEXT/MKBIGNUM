Function: MKBIGNUM

Syntax:   (MKBIGNUM list1)
    or:   (MAKE-BIGNUM list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list of at least 2 fixnums.

Returns:

 A bignum created from the fixnums in list1.

Processing:

 The contents of the list is dependent upon the internal implementation
 of bignums.  See $BIGNUM for more information.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a proper list of at least 2 fixnums.
 Invalid list of fixnums:
  zero in most-significant-word position
  negative value in position other than first
  the bignum would have had the value -2147483648 (most negative fixnum)
 Not enough space to build bignum.

Notes:

  BIGLIST will turn the bignum back into a list.

Examples:

 (MKBIGNUM '(0 1))            ==> 21

 (MKBIGNUM '(-2147483647 1))  ==> -21
