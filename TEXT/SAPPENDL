Function: STRING-APPENDL

Syntax:   (STRING-SAPPENDL list1)
    or:   (SAPPENDL list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a list of strings.

Returns:

 A string made up of all the elements of list1 concatenated to form a
 new string.

Processing:

 If list1 is NIL, a null string is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Argument other than a string contained within the list.

Notes:

 (SAPPENDL a) is equivalent to (APPLY #'STRING-APPEND a), but faster.

 As for many functions that take strings as arguments, symbols are
 permitted; their print names are used in that case.

 Arguments other than symbols and strings are not permitted.  (This
 is unlike CONCATL, for example, that allows most atomic objects in
 the list argument, but makes a symbol.)  Use TOSTRING to transform
 numbers, for example, into strings.

Examples:

 (SAPPENDL NIL)                    ==> ""
 (SAPPENDL '("A"))                 ==> "A"
 (SAPPENDL '("foo" "bar" "baz"))   ==> "foobarbaz"
