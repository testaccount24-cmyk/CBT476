Function: UCONCATL

Syntax:   (UCONCATL arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list of atoms.

Returns:

 An uninterned symbol whose print name consists of the atoms in the list
 specified by arg1 concatenated to form a new atom name.

Processing:

 The CAR's of arg1, which must be a non-null list of atoms, are
 converted to the character representations that they have when printed
 via PRINC.  These are the actual print names for symbols, the text for
 strings, converted representations for numbers, and internally
 generated values for other types.  The resulting character strings are
 concatenated together to build an uninterned symbol whose name is that
 string.

 arg1 may be NIL, in which case a symbol with a null print name is
 returned.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a list of atoms (nested lists and vectors are not permitted).

Notes:

 Compare CONCATL, which is identical to UCONCATL except that it
 returns an interned symbol.

 (CONCATL x) is equivalent to (APPLY #'CONCAT x), but more efficient.

 (UCONCATL x) is equivalent to (APPLY #'UCONCAT x), but more efficient.


Examples:

 (UCONCATL '(A))                 ==> A
 (UCONCATL '(F O O))             ==> FOO
 (UCONCATL '(FOO BAR))           ==> FOOBAR
 (UCONCATL '(007 1.0 "foobar"))  ==> |71.0foobar| ; A symbol.

 (SETQ A (UCONCATL '(F O O)))    ==> FOO ; uninterned.
 (EQ A 'FOO)                     ==> NIL
