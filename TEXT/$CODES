 *** EXECUTION-TIME ZIL ABENDS, ERRORS AND MESSAGES ***


If you get a system abend code, here are some probable causes:


001,002 - I/O error.  Probably not disastrous; the most likely cause
      is that you are attempting to read from a partitioned data set
      (PDS) without specifying a member name.  002 is the code
      associated with errors doing I/O to variable-length records.

0C3 - disastrous error, either in the garbage collector or some other
      routine with relatively new code in it that has a path needing
      to be verified without the overhead of a whole new error code.
      Such abends should be reported immediately, and a dump should
      be obtained where possible.

0C4 - some probable causes:
      (a) An attempt was made to use the CAR or CDR of an atom in
          compiled code, to access an element of a vector with an
          invalid index, or access some part of an object when the
          target was not of the correct type.  ZIL considers this an
          error, but does not check for it in compiled code.
      (b) A low-level ZIL function was passed an object of the wrong
          type, but the function did no error checking because it was
          coded for speed.
      (c) One of the internal ZIL modules was erroneously called as
          a function.

013 - OPEN error.  Check that the file being referenced was properly
      allocated.  A nonexistent member name may have been specified.

213 - OPEN error.  A data set was allocated but did not really exist
      (it may have been deleted by the TSO DELETE command without
      having been freed).

737 - file error.  A nonexistent member name may have been specified
      in a concatenation.

913 - file could not be accessed because it was protected by RACF/ACF2.

B37 - out-of-space condition on an output file.  Check that your code
      is not in a loop writing output.  You may have to recreate the
      dataset outside of ZIL with a larger size.

D37 - out-of-space condition on an output file - no secondary allocation
      was specified.  See description of B37 above for more information.

E37 - out-of-space condition writing to a PDS member.  See description
      of B37 above for more information.

80A, 106, 878, etc. -
      A TSO command or other system function was unable to get enough
      storage to execute.  This can happen if you are running a ZIL
      application that loads many large compiled modules.  If you are
      running under ISPF in split screen mode, try terminating the other
      logical screen.  If you are using PIE/Sessions, try terminating
      other active PIE sessions.  Otherwise, try restarting the ZIL
      application with a lower value for CSSIZE or VSSIZE.  If this does
      not help, try logging on with a larger region size, or increasing
      the REGION parameter in your batch job.

 For messages below which result in errors, the code listed is returned
 as a user abend code, unless the program is intercepting errors (a
 CATCH with a tag of NIL will trap such errors).  Errors signalled by
 the ERROR function will cause the active LISP program to abend with a
 user abend code of zero if there is no error interception.

 Note: At the present time, there is no in-depth documentation for the
       meanings of those messages which are not self-evident (there's no
       explanation for self-evident messages either, of course).  This
       should be provided some time in the future.  However, most such
       errors will be easily recognized and all are recoverable, with
       the exception of internal errors detected by the garbage
       collector, which are always fatal.


 The severity flags are as follows:

  0  -  Informational.
  1  -  Warning.
  2  -  Error.  These usually cause a THROW to tag NIL (signal error).
  3  -  Severe. These are unusual but non-fatal conditions.
  F  -  Fatal. These cause ZIL to be terminated.

 With the exception of fatal error messages, the display of these
 can be overridden by the appropriate (MSGLEVEL n) function call.
