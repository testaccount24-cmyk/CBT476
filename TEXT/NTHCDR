Function: NTHCDR

Syntax:   (NTHCDR arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 The "n'th" sublist of the list specified by arg2, where arg1 selects
 which sublist, counting from zero.

Processing:

 If arg1 is greater than or equal to the length of the list specified by
 arg2, NIL is returned.  Otherwise the "nth" CDR of the list is
 returned, as follows:

  (NTHCDR 0 list) is equivalent to list,
  (NTHCDR 1 list) is equivalent to (CDR list),
  (NTHCDR 2 list) is equivalent to (CDDR list),
  etc.

Errors signaled:

 First argument not a fixnum, or is negative.
 Second argument not a proper list or NIL.

Notes:

 Although (NTHCDR 1 list) is equivalent to (CDR list), it is not as
 efficient since the first argument is always evaluated arithmetically.

Examples:

 (NTHCDR 0 '(A B C))      ==> (A B C)
 (NTHCDR 1 '(A B C))      ==> (B C)
 (NTHCDR 2 '(A B C))      ==> (C)
 (NTHCDR 3 '(A B C))      ==> NIL
 (NTHCDR 4 '(A B C))      ==> NIL
