 The following global SPECIAL variables are defined to ZIL at
 initialization time.  Note that to bind these, you MUST include
 a SPECIAL declaration for them - ZIL will not assume they are
 SPECIAL otherwise.


  *version*            - a string identifying the current version
                         of ZIL (i.e., "1.3").

  *features*           - a list of symbols naming "features"
                          (see FEATUREP for more info).

  *load-verbose*       - the default value of the :VERBOSE keyword
                         used by the LOAD function (q.v.).

  *loadfile*           - identifies the current file being loaded,
                         for a function's LOADFILE property.

  *trace*              - used internally by TRACE.
  *trace-indent*       - used internally by TRACE.
  *gentemp-counter*    - used internally by GENTEMP.
  *mxsetf-initialized* - used internally by SETF.

  *zil-source-library* - a string identifying the library containing
                         ZIL LISP source code, used by the
                         (zil-source-member ...) macro to load or
                         include source members.  The default is:

                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.LISP"  -  production
                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.NLISP" -  test
                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.OLISP" -  backup

                         Note that the string, although containing a
                         fully qualified data set name, does not
                         contain single quotes.  This is to make it
                         easier to construct a dsname(member) string.

  *zil-help-library*   - a string identifying the library containing
                         ZIL help information, used by the ZILHELP
                         function (and, by extension, HELP).
                         Changing this changes the library from which
                         HELP fetches its members.  The default is:

                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT"  -  production
                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.NTEXT" -  test
                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.OTEXT" -  backup

                         Note that the string, although containing a
                         fully qualified data set name, does not
                         contain single quotes.  This is to make it
                         easier to construct a dsname(member) string.

  *zil-panel-library*  - a string identifying the library containing
                         ZIL ISPF panels, used by the ZFSEXEC function.
                         Changing this changes where the ISPF interface
                         finds the default panels.  The default is:

                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.PANEL"  -  production
                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.NPANEL" -  test
                           "PROGLIB.ZIL.OPANEL" -  backup

                         Note that the string, although containing a
                         fully qualified data set name, does not
                         contain single quotes.  This is to make it
                         easier to construct a dsname(member) string.
