Function: UNKEYWORDIFY

Syntax:   (UNKEYWORDIFY arg1)
    or:   (UNKWDIFY arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 A symbol whose print name is equal to the print name of
 arg1 minus the leading colon (":") if any.

Processing:

 If arg1 is not a "keyword", itself is returned.  Otherwise,
 an interned symbol is created whose print name is equal to
 the print name of arg1 without the initial colon.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a symbol.

Notes:

 Since ZIL 1.3 does not have a package system, it does not have true
 Common Lisp "keywords".  However, any symbol with a print name starting
 with a colon is treated as a "keyword" in ZIL.  Such symbols evaluate
 to themselves and cannot be used as lambda list arguments.

Examples:

 (UNKEYWORDIFY 'A)         ==> A
 (UNKEYWORDIFY ':B)        ==> B
 (UNKEYWORDIFY '|:|)       ==> ||
 (UNKEYWORDIFY ':TEST)     ==> TEST
 (UNKEYWORDIFY 'TEST)      ==> TEST
