   The ZIL FORTRAN Interface

To implement some of the more esoteric mathematical functions, ZIL
utilizes the VS FORTRAN subroutine library.  In order to enable these
functions to execute, you must have the VS FORTRAN subroutine library
available to ZIL at run time.

This library, normally 'SYS1.FORTLIB', need not be allocated at ZIL
run time.  The required FORTRAN subroutines are linkedited with ZIL
module ZIFINIT, which is loaded the first time a ZIL mathematical
subroutine is used.

VS FORTRAN version 1 release 4, VS FORTRAN version 2, or a
higher version/release, is required in order to use these functions.

The following functions utilize the ZIL FORTRAN interface:

   ACOS
   ASIN
   ATAN
   COS
   EXP
   LOG
   SIN
   SQRT
   TAN

(This list will be added to as time goes by.)

Both single and double precision versions of these routines are used.
