Function: ZEVDSUB

Syntax:   (ZEVDSUB sym1 subr2)

 sym1  (required, evaluated) - a symbol.
 subr2 (required, evaluated) - a compiled SUBR object.

Returns:

 subr2, after assigning it to be the compiled code definition of sym1.

Processing:

 This function is called by compiled code in MODULE's that issue
 DEFUN to define compiled functions.  It assigns subr2 as the SUBR
 property of the symbol sym1.

 Any existing function or macro definitions are removed from sym1
 before subr2 is assigned.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 ZEVDSUB always creates a COMPILED definition.

 subr2 could just as easily be a compiled lexical closure, but ZIL
 at present does not do this.
