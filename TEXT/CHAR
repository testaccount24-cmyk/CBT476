Function: CHAR

Syntax:   (CHAR string1 index2)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 index2  (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.

Returns:

 The index2'th character of string1, as a fixnum.

Processing:

 index2 is used as a zero-based index into string1, where the characters
 of the string are indexed from 0 to the string length minus 1.

 The resultant character is made into the fixnum representing the
 EBCDIC value of the character.

 If index2 is out of bounds with respect to the string, NIL is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid first argument (not a string).
 Invalid second argument (not a fixnum).

Notes:

 Observe the distinctions between the character extracting functions:

 GETCHAR   -  uses one-based indexing, returns a symbol.
 GETCHARN  -  uses one-based indexing, returns a fixnum.
 CHAR      -  uses zero-based indexing, returns a fixnum.

Examples:

 (CHAR "foo" 0)           ==> #\f
 (CHAR "foo" 1)           ==> #\o
 (CHAR "foo" 2)           ==> #\o
 (CHAR "foo" 3)           ==> NIL
 (CHAR "foo" 4)           ==> NIL
 (CHAR 'BAR 0)            ==> #\B
 (CHAR 'BAR 1)            ==> #\A
 (CHAR 'BAR 2)            ==> #\R
 (CHAR 'BAR 3)            ==> NIL
