Function: FSZIL

Syntax:   (FSZIL)

Returns:

 T, after invoking an ISPF dialog implementation of the ZIL Lisp
 interpreter in scrollable full-screen mode, until the END key is
 pressed by the terminal user.

Processing:

 FSZIL uses the ZFSEXEC service to present an ISPF dialog loop which
 consists of:

  displaying the FSZIL panel

  accepting S-expressions from the user, entered on the panel

  terminating if the END command is typed (or the END key is pressed)

  processing any dialog commands entered on the ISPF command line

  evaluating the input S-expression, resulting in zero or more values
  which, along with any other generated standard output, are captured
  and directed to the panel display.

Errors signaled:

 ISPF environment not active.

Notes:

 ZIL-MVS only.  ISPF version 2 required.  If PDF is not installed
 along with ISPF, attempts to display error messages may fail.

 Evaluation of expressions that attempt to read from standard input
 will be dramatically unsuccessful.
