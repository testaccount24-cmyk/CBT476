Function: SETPBIND

Syntax:   (SETPBIND arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 arg2, after arg2 replaces the contents of the value/binding cell of
 arg1.

Processing:

 arg2 destructively replaces the contents of the value/binding cell
 of arg1.  See PBIND for what this contains.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 This function is intended for internal use only, and is intimately
 tied up with ZIL's binding techniques.  Do not depend on it!

Examples:
