Function: PPDATE

Syntax:   (PPDATE &optional date1)

 date1 (optional, evaluated) - a list of 3 fixnums.

Returns:

 A string containing the date represented by date1 in "pretty" format.

Processing:

 If date1 is omitted, the current date is used.  Otherwise, date1 is
 assumed to be a list (year month day) in a format like that returned
 by CURDATE (CURRENT-DATE).

 If a year less than 100 is supplied as part of the date argument, a
 windowing algorithm is used to convert it to a valid four-digit year.
 The algorithm is the one described in "Common Lisp: The Language",
 Second Edition.  It is an error to provide a three-digit year.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid date.

Notes:

 See CURDATE for disclaimers.

Examples:

; (PPDATE)            ==> "August 15, 1986"   ; on August 15, 1986

; (PPDATE '(1 1 1))   ==> "January 1, 2001"   ; on April 13, 2000

; (PPDATE '(99 12 31))==> "December 31, 1999" ; on April 13, 2000
