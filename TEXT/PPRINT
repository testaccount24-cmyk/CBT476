Function: PPRINT

Syntax:   (PPRINT arg1 &optional file2)
    or:   (PRETTY-PRINT arg1 &optional file2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a LISP object.
 file2 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 No values, after the LISP object specified by arg1 is pretty-printed on
 the file specified by file2.

Processing:

 arg1 is printed on the output file specified by file2 in such a way as
 to:

  (1) be as readable as possible to the human user.
  (2) be able to be read back in as LISP code.

 This is known as "pretty printing."

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 See also PP and ZILPP, which pretty-print function definitions.

Examples:

 (PPRINT '(foo bar (baz frob) (mumble frotz)))

  causes the following to be printed on the standard output file:

 (FOO BAR (BAZ FROB)
          (MUMBLE FROTZ))

  Note that the exact format may vary, depending on the state of
  development of the ZIL pretty-printer.
