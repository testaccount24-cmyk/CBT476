Function: EQL

Syntax:   (EQL arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if the types and contents of arg1 and arg2 are identical, else NIL.

Processing:

 If the arguments are EQ, regardless of type, the result is
 always true (i.e. T is returned).

 If the types of the arguments are different, the result is
 always false (i.e. NIL is returned).

 If both arguments are numbers, a numeric compare is performed of
 the appropriate number type.  Remember that the types must match.

 If both arguments are strings, the string contents are compared.
 Case is significant.

 For all other types (including symbols and lists), the two arguments
 are considered EQL if and only if they are EQ.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 See member $EQUAL for more information about equality predicates.

Examples:

 (EQL 'FOO 'FOO)     ==> T
 (EQL 'A 'B)         ==> NIL
 (EQL (ADD1 1) 2)    ==> T
 (EQL 1 1.0)         ==> NIL
 (EQL 'A "A")        ==> NIL
 (EQL "A" "A")       ==> T
 (EQL "A" "a")       ==> NIL
