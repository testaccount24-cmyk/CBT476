Function: SPECIAL-ALIST

Syntax:   (SPECIAL-ALIST)
    or:   (SALIST)

Returns:

 The current special variable binding environment (alist).

Processing:

 The current special variable binding environment, normally implemented
 in ZIL as an "association list" of dotted pairs of dynamically bound
 symbols and their values, is returned.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 SETSALST, or SETF on SPECIAL-ALIST, may be used to update this. But
 please don't unless you really know what you are doing.

 The value of the "special alist" is reset by a THROW, even if
 it has been changed via SETF of SPECIAL-ALIST.

 In ZIL 1.3 there are two variable binding "alists": the
 "special alist" and the "lexical alist". The "special alist" is used
 to implement SPECIAL variable bindings, and the "lexical alist" is
 used to effect lexical bindings in cases where the bindings are
 across LAMBDA boundaries or captured by lexical closures.
