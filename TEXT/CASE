Macro: CASE

Syntax:  (CASE arg1 (arg2a arg2b ... arg2z) ... (argna argnb ... argnz))

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

 arg2a (not evaluated) - one of the following:

   T or OTHERWISE
   an atom
   a list of one or more elements

 arg2n (optional, conditionally evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The last element of a clause for which arg1 matches the first element,
 either by being EQL to it or by being a member of it.

Processing:

 The general format of CASE is:

   (CASE form                                                           ))
       (test1 consequent1 ... consequentn)
       (test2 consequent1 ... consequentn)
       ...
       (testn consequent1 ... consequentn)
   )

 in which the "testn"'s are generally lists of values (NOT evaluated),
 although an atomic value (other than NIL) is interpreted as a list
 of one value; or T or OTHERWISE, meaning none-of-the-above.

 The "form" is evaluated and compared (using EQL) to the constant
 values specified by the "testn"s.  When it matches (via EQL or MEMBER)
 the forms in that clause containing the "testn" are evaluated as an
 implicit PROGN, and the rest of the CASE is skipped.
 If none of the clauses match, NIL is returned.


Errors signaled:

 Invalid syntax (missing or invalid arguments).

Notes:

 CASE attempts to generate EQ and/or MEMQ tests where applicable,
 for maximum efficiency.  Because of this, it is not necessary to
 use CASEQ, which is identical to CASE, and is available for
 Maclisp compatibility.

 For a complete discussion of CASE, refer to a MACLisp or Common LISP
 reference manual.

Examples:

(DEFUN TESTCASE (A)
 (CASE A
  (0 "zero")
  (1 "one")
  ((2) "two")
  ((3 4 5) "three, four or five")
  (t "some other number")
 ))                                   ==> TESTCASE

 (TESTCASE 0)     ==> "zero"
 (TESTCASE 1)     ==> "one"
 (TESTCASE 2)     ==> "two"
 (TESTCASE 3)     ==> "three, four or five"
 (TESTCASE 4)     ==> "three, four or five"
 (TESTCASE 5)     ==> "three, four or five"
 (TESTCASE 6)     ==> "some other number"
