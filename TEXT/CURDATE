Function: CURDATE

Syntax:   (CURDATE)
    or:   (CURRENT-DATE)

Returns:

 A list of 3 integers, representing the current date as the year,
 month, and day of month.

Processing:

 The current date is determined and converted from Julian to Gregorian,
 and a list is made of the 3 components.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The algorithm used to determine if the current year is a leap year
 will fail in the year 2100, and for all multiples of 100 that are
 not also multiples of 400 thereafter.

 If a garbage collection occurs while building the list, the date
 returned may be inaccurate if it was requested before midnight
 but the GC completed after midnight.

 The year returned is a 4-digit year, as opposed to Zil prior to
 2000, which was not Y2K compliant and returned a 2-digit year.

Examples:

; (CURDATE)     ==> (86 8 12)   ; on August 12, 1986
; (CURDATE)     ==> (2000 4 13) ; on April 13, 2000
