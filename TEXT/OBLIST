Function: OBLIST

Syntax:   (OBLIST)

Returns:

 The current list (oblist) of interned symbols.

Processing:

 A list of all the currently interned symbols is returned.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Do not perform destructive operations on the oblist.  Such actions have
 unpredictable results, and could conceivably be dangerous to the ZIL
 environment.

 The officially sanctioned Common Lisp way of accessing interned
 symbols is via the MAPATOMS macro.  Use of the (OBLIST) function
 is frowned upon, and will probably cause experienced LISP programmers
 to laugh at your use of such a blatantly old-fashioned feature.
