Function: ACOS

Syntax:   (ACOS num1)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the arccosine of num1 in radians.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the
 value from num1.  If num1 is a single-precision flonum, the
 result is a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is
 a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

 num1 not a number between -1 and 1.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

Examples:

 (ACOS 0)     ==>   1.57079632
 (ACOS -1)    ==>   3.14159265
 (ACOS 1)     ==>   0.0
 (ACOS 1.0d0) ==>   0.0
 (ACOS 1.0f0) ==>   0.0F0
 (ACOS 0.5)   ==>   1.04719755
 (ACOS 0.5F0) ==>   1.0471973F0
