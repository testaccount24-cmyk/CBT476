Function: UNEBCDIC

Syntax:   (UNEBCDIC arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a string or symbol whose text or print
                              name is 1 character.

Returns:

 A fixnum representing the EBCDIC value of the single-character atom
 specified by arg1.

Processing:

 The character representation of arg1, which should be a symbol or
 string, is used to construct the fixnum which is its EBCDIC value.

Errors signaled:

 First argument not a string or symbol of 1 character.

Notes:

 Compare EBCDIC, which does the reverse.  Note, however, that
 (UNEBCDIC (EBCDIC x)) does NOT return x if the value of x is not
 between 0 and 255.

Examples:

 (UNEBCDIC 'A)        ==> 193
 (UNEBCDIC '|a|)      ==> 129
 (UNEBCDIC "a")       ==> 129
 (UNEBCDIC '\\)       ==> 224
