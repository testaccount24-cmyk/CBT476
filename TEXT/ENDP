Function: ENDP

Syntax:   (ENDP arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is NIL, NIL if arg1 is a CONS.

Processing:

 If arg1 is NIL, then T is returned.  If arg1 is a CONS (a non-null
 list), NIL is returned.  If arg1 is not NIL or a CONS, an error is
 signaled.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not NIL or a CONS.  Note that this error may not be signaled
 in compiled code.

Notes:

 ENDP is the recommended way of testing for the end of a list.  It
 supports "proper lists" only, not lists ending in an atom.

Examples:

 (ENDP NIL)              ==> T
 (ENDP '(NIL))           ==> NIL
 (ENDP '(A B C))         ==> NIL
