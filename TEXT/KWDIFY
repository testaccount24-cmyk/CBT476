Function: KEYWORDIFY

Syntax:   (KEYWORDIFY arg1)
    or:   (KWDIFY arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 A "keyword" symbol whose print name is equal to the print name of
 arg1 prefixed with a colon (":").

Processing:

 If arg1 is already a "keyword", itself is returned.  Otherwise,
 a colon is concatenated with the print name of arg1 and a new
 symbol is interned with that name.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a symbol.

Notes:

 Since ZIL 1.3 does not have a package system, it does not have true
 Common Lisp "keywords".  However, any symbol with a print name starting
 with a colon is treated as a "keyword" in ZIL.  Such symbols evaluate
 to themselves and cannot be used as lambda list arguments.

Examples:

 (KEYWORDIFY 'A)          ==> :A
 (KEYWORDIFY :B)          ==> :B
 (KEYWORDIFY NIL)         ==> :NIL
 (KEYWORDIFY '|foo|)      ==> |:foo|
 (KEYWORDIFY "foo")       ==> ("***ERROR***")
