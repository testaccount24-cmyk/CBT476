Special Form: QUOTE

Syntax:   (QUOTE arg1)

 arg1 (required, not evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The first argument.

Processing:

 QUOTE is the general way of specifying "constant" values in LISP.

 The reader macro ' (hex 7D) is a shorthand for the QUOTE function,
 so that 'form is the same as (QUOTE form).

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 (LIST 'a 'b 'c) is equivalent to (QUOTE (a b c)) in the interpretive
 environment, but in the compiled environment the former builds a new
 list out of CONS cells each time it is executed, while the latter
 creates an in-line constant list in the load module whose address is
 loaded.  If the list may be modified during execution of the program,
 you MUST use the LIST form rather than the QUOTE form.

 The ' abbreviation for QUOTE is implemented as a reader macro.
 See $RMACRO for more information on reader macros.

Examples:

 (QUOTE A)          ==> A
 (QUOTE 001)        ==> 1
 (QUOTE |001|)      ==> |001|     ; note that this is a symbol.
 (QUOTE (A B C))    ==> (A B C)
 (QUOTE (QUOTE A))  ==> (QUOTE A)

;Equivalent to the above are:

 'A                 ==> A
 '001               ==> 1
 '|001|             ==> |001|     ; note that this is a symbol.
 '(A B C)           ==> (A B C)
 ''A                ==> (QUOTE A)
