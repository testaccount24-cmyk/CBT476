Function: BOOLE

Syntax:   (BOOLE op1 arg2 arg3 &rest args)

 op1  (required, evaluated) - a fixnum between 0 and 15, inclusive.
 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 args (optional, evaluated) - a fixnum.

Returns:

 A fixnum containing the result of a logical operation performed on
 arg1, arg2 and other args if specified.  The logical operation is
 specified by op1.

Processing:

 If additional args are specified, the operation is performed in a
 left-associative manner.  Otherwise, the operation is performed on
 arg1 and arg2.

 This is a fixnum-only operation.  op1 specifies the Boolean operation
 to be performed on args 2 and 3 via a "truth table" as follows:

 (Note - this table is taken from p. 223, "Common LISP: The Language",
         Guy L. Steele, Jr., Digital Press, 1984.  However, the actual
         bit configurations are given only in the Maclisp manual.)

           arg2 bit:  0   1   0   1
           arg3 bit:  0   0   1   1
     op1                              Operation or value returned
