Function: IFILEP

Syntax:   (IFILEP file1)

 file1 (required, evaluated) - a file name.

Returns:

 T if file1 is a valid input file, else NIL.

Processing:

 If the file specified by file1 is an already open input file, then T is
 returned.  If the file is not an already open input file, then an
 attempt is made to open the file name consisting of 'ZILI' + the file
 name, as for all ZIL file accessing functions.  If such a file exists,
 T is returned; otherwise NIL is returned.  If any error occurs trying
 to process the file, the error is signalled; in other words, IFILEP
 suppresses "file does not exist" errors only.

Errors signaled:

 See above description.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 Because an MVS file (ddname) allocation remains around even after
 the file is closed under ZIL, issuing IFILEP against a closed
 input file will cause the file to be reopened.

Examples:

 (IFILEP NIL)    will always return T.

 (IFILEP 'FOO)   returns T if a ddname ZILIFOO is allocated to a
                 usable data set.

 (IFILEP (OPEN "cmd.clist(zlogon)"))     should return T.
