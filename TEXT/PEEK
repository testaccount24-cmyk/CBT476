Function: PEEK

Syntax:   (PEEK arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.

Returns:

 A fixnum whose contents represent the contents of the fullword of
 virtual storage at the memory location pointed to by arg1.

Processing:

 arg1 is interpreted as a 31-bit address and is used as a pointer to
 access active main storage.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a fixnum.

Notes:

 Currently this function does not check the validity of the address.
 Therefore, 0C4 ABENDs are likely when using this function.

Examples:

 (PEEK 0)                 ==> 67895296  ; i.e. X'040C0000'
