Function: TERPRI

Syntax:   (TERPRI &optional file1)

 file1 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 NIL, after the current line of the output file specified by the
 first argument is written out.

Processing:

 Each invocation of TERPRI causes a line to be written out to the
 specified output file.  If no data has been written to the current
 line, a line of blanks is written out.

 The current character position is reset to 1 when TERPRI is issued,
 and the output line is cleared to blanks.

 The CTERPRI, PRINC, PRIN1 and PRINT functions automatically invoke
 TERPRI when they need to; see the documentation for these functions for
 more information.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid output file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified output file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 See member $PRINTER for more information on printing functions

Examples:

 (TERPRI)
 (TERPRI NIL) ...are equivalent and return NIL after writing the
                 current line of standard output.

 (TERPRI 'FOO) ...writes out the contents of the current line of
                  output file FOO.
