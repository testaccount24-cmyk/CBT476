Function: FUNARGP

Syntax:   (FUNARGP arg1)

 arg1 (required,evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is an interpreted lexical closure (funarg), otherwise NIL.

Processing:

 An interpreted lexical closure is the result of evaluating the
 special form (FUNCTION ...); this creates an object consisting of a
 pointer to an object that can be FUNCALL'ed or APPLY'ed and a pointer
 to the environment current at the time the closure was created.

 Funargs may be passed to APPLY or specified as the CAR of a list
 passed to EVAL.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The FUNCTION special form in the compiled environment does not create a
 FUNARGP form; rather, it creates a compiled closure.  The predicate
 CLOSUREP returns T for such an object.

 See also MKFUNARG, the low-level function that builds funargs.

Examples:

 (FUNARGP 'CAR)          ==> NIL
 (FUNARGP (FUNCTION CAR)) ==> T ; in the interpretive environment
;(FUNARGP (FUNCTION CAR)) ==> NIL ; compiled
 (FUNARGP (ZILLOAD 'CAR)) ==> NIL
