  ZCPRINT is the low-level interface to the "current ZIL printer",
  called by PRINC, PRIN1, CTERPRI, TERPRI and TYO.

  ZDPRINT is the "default ZIL printer", set to be the "current ZIL
  printer" at ZIL initialization time but not otherwise called by
  built-in ZIL code.

  ZILSPRT is the low-level function that takes a SUBR argument and makes
  it the new "current ZIL printer".

  SETPRT is the function that takes any function object and causes it to
  be the new "current ZIL printer".

  Any function which is to act as the "current ZIL printer", including
  ZCPRINT and ZDPRINT, takes three required arguments:

  arg 1 = the object to be printed, if applicable.
  arg 2 = the file to print it on.
  arg 3 = a fixnum built from the following boolean values:

       ..00  =  print a character object (TYO)
       ..01  =  print a LISP object (PRINC/PRIN1)
       ..10  =  control, not print (CTERPRI/TERPRI)
       .x..  =  0 = don't slashify, 1 = slashify
       x...  =  0 = unconditional, 1 = conditional

  The following ZIL printing functions are defined as follows:

   (DEFUN TYO     (X &OPTIONAL F) (ZCPRINT X F #b0000))  ; arg 3 =  0
   (DEFUN PRINC   (X &OPTIONAL F) (ZCPRINT X F #b0001))  ; arg 3 =  1
   (DEFUN PRIN1   (X &OPTIONAL F) (ZCPRINT X F #b0101))  ; arg 3 =  5
   (DEFUN TERPRI  (  &OPTIONAL F) (ZCPRINT X F #b0010))  ; arg 3 =  2
   (DEFUN CTERPRI (  &OPTIONAL F) (ZCPRINT X F #b1010))  ; arg 3 = 10

  PRINT and PRINTC are built on calls to the above ZIL functions.
  All ZIL code that calls these functions is affected by the setting
  of the "current ZIL printer".

  All output is affected except:

  * Error messages from ZIL functions (except for functions written
    in LISP)

  * System messages like GC messages
