Function: ZEVSET

Syntax:   (ZEVSET var1 val2)

 var1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.
 val2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 val2, after the variable specified by var1 has been bound
 to the value specified by val2.

Processing:

 The current dynamic (SPECIAL) binding of var1 is altered to be val2;
 in other words, the "value" of var1 is set to val2.

 See SET for more details.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 ZEVSET is the internal ZIL function that implements dynamic binding
 assignments (SET and SETQ).

 No error checking is done.  ZEVSET assumes that you have passed it
 a valid, non-self-evaluating symbol.  If you have not, results
 could be disastrous.
