Macro: ZILTEST

Syntax:   (ZILTEST arg1)

 arg1 (optional, not evaluated) - a string or symbol.

Returns:

 T, after testing the contents of the documentation or test file
 specified by arg1.

Processing:

 If arg1 is a string, it is the name of a dataset containing only
 test data (the format of which is described below).

 If arg1 is a symbol, it is the name of a member of the ZIL on-line
 help library (the value of the variable *ZIL-HELP-LIBRARY*) which
 contains test data following the word "Examples:" (which must be
 the first word on the line and include the colon).

 The test data consists of groups of three forms:  a LISP expression
 to be evaluated, the symbol ==>, and a LISP expression representing
 the value of the first expression.  (Note that none of these are
 quoted.)

 ZILTEST evaluates the first expression and compares it to the third,
 and keeps a count of how many are not equal (the comparison is like
 LISP EQUAL, but is fudged for floating-point numbers and vectors).
 Error messages are displayed for all cases that fail the test.

 If a form is supposed to signal an error, the third form must be
 ("***ERROR***"), i.e. a list containing the string "***ERROR***".

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a string or symbol.
 arg1 not found (member not in help library, or dataset doesn't exist).

Notes:

Examples:

 (ZILTEST 'CAR) tests the on-line documentation for the CAR function.

 (ZILTEST "my.data(test)") runs my.data(test) as a checkout.
