Function: ZILPROGV

Syntax:   (ZILPROGV varlist1 vallist2 closure3)

 varlist1 (required, evaluated) - a list of symbols.
 vallist2 (required, evaluated) - a list of LISP objects.
 closure3 (required, evaluated) - a lexical closure.

Returns:

 The value returned by executing closure3 in a SPECIAL variable binding
 environment specified by varlist1 and vallist2.

Processing:

 See PROGV.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 ZILPROGV is the internal ZIL function that underlies PROGV, which is
 implemented as a macro which expands by turning the forms into a
 lexical closure.  This should be kept in mind when compiling PROGV
 constructs.
