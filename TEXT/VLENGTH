Function: VLENGTH

Syntax:   (VLENGTH arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a vector-type object.

Returns:

 An integer containing the number of elements in the vector
 specified by arg1; i.e. the length of the vector.

Processing:

 The length of the vector (a vector is conceptually the same as
 a one-dimensional array) is returned as an integer.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a vector-type object (does not satisfy VECP).

Notes:

 This function was formerly known as VDIM, which name is still
 available for compatibility.

 A "vector-type object" is an object composed of contiguous instances
 of other LISP objects.  In ZIL, vectors, structures and funargs
 (interpreted lexical closures) are vector-type objects that satisfy
 the predicate VECP.

Examples:

 (VLENGTH #(FOO BAR BAZ))       ==> 3
 (VLENGTH #())                  ==> 0
 (VLENGTH (MKVECTOR 10))        ==> 10
 (VLENGTH (STRUCTURE 'A 'B 'C)) ==> 3
