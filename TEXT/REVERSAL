Function: REVERSALL

Syntax:   (REVERSALL arg1)
    or:   (REVERSAL arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 A list consisting of the elements of argument 1 in reverse order,
 with all the sublists reversed as well.

Processing:

 A new list is built (through repeated CONS'ing) from the elements
 of the first list.  Any sublists are recursively reversed.

 Compare REVERSE, which reorders the top-level elements but does not
 recursively reverse them.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 No checking is done as to the validity of the argument.
 Unpredictable results will occur if the argument is not a proper list.

Examples:

 (REVERSAL NIL)              ==> NIL
 (REVERSAL '(A))             ==> (A)
 (REVERSAL '(A B C D))       ==> (D C B A)
 (REVERSAL '((A B) (C D)))   ==> ((D C) (B A))
