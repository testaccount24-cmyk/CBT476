Function: EXPLODEN

Syntax:   (EXPLODEN arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 A list of fixnums corresponding to the character representation of arg1
 as printed out via PRINC.

Processing:

 arg1 is converted to the character representation which it has when it
 is printed - as it looks via PRINC.  Each character in this
 representation is then used to build a fixnum whose value is the EBCDIC
 representation of that single character, and all of these fixnums are
 consed together to form a list, which is returned as the value.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Compare EXPLODEC, which is similar but generates a list of interned
 symbols.

 EXPLODEN is analogous to EXPLODEC in that it uses the PRINC-style
 format of its argument.  There is no analogous function that creates
 a list of fixnums in PRIN1 format.  If you don't believe me, go and
 check the Maclisp manual.

Examples:

 (EXPLODEN 'A)     ==> (193)
 (EXPLODEN "A")    ==> (193)
 (EXPLODEN "a")    ==> (129)
 (EXPLODEN NIL)    ==> (#\N #\I #\L)
 (EXPLODEN 007)    ==> (247)
 (EXPLODEN '|007|) ==> (240 240 247)
