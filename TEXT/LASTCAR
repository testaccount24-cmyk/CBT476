Function: LASTCAR

Syntax:   (LASTCAR arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 The CAR of the last sublist of the list specified by arg1.

Processing:

 If arg1 is NIL or atomic, itself is returned.
 If arg1 is a proper list, the last element of the list is returned.
 If arg1 is a list ending in a dotted pair (a cons whose CAR is not
 NIL), the CDR of that dotted pair is returned.

 Note that (LASTCAR x) is NOT equivalent to (CAR (LAST x)) because
 of this last case.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

Examples:

 (LASTCAR NIL)                  ==> NIL
 (LASTCAR '(A))                 ==> A
 (LASTCAR '(A B . C))           ==> C   ;  ! not B
 (LASTCAR '(A B C D))           ==> D
 (LASTCAR '((A B) (C D)))       ==> (C D)
