Function: MKATOM

Syntax:   (MKATOM string1 &optional arg2 arg3)
    or:   (MAKE-ATOM string1 &optional arg2 arg3)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.
 arg3 (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.

Returns:

 If arg3 is specified and non-NIL, and string1 is syntactically
 numeric, a numeric atom which, when printed, looks like string1;
 otherwise a symbol whose print name consists of string1.

Processing:

 If arg3 is omitted or NIL, string1 is used to build a new symbol
 whose print name is string1.  The symbol is interned only if arg2
 is specified and non-NIL.

 If arg3 is specified and non-NIL, then an attempt is made to build a
 numeric atom (fixnum, flonum or bignum), according to the syntax of
 string1 as the READ function would interpret it.  If the string is not
 syntactically numeric, then a symbol is created as for the case above,
 with arg2 determining whether to intern the symbol.

 Note that when a non-NIL third argument is specified, the following
 holds true:

 (1) If the atom is numeric, the setting of the second argument is
     ignored, since only symbols are ever interned on the oblist.

 (2) If the atom is syntactically non-numeric, a symbol will be created.
     In this case the setting of the second argument is significant.

 (3) List notation (parentheses, dots, etc.) is not valid and will
     be treated as part of a symbol name.

 (4) Floating-point overflow is not detected by the code, and may
     result in a program check (0CC) abend.  Floating-point underflow is
     ignored and may produce a zero result.

Errors signaled:

 string1 not a string or symbol.                                        ).

Notes:

 See MAKE-NUMBER, which takes 1 argument and is a convenient way
 of specifying MAKE-ATOM with a third argument of T.  MAKE-NUMBER
 may create a symbol, but will never intern it.

Examples:

 (MAKE-ATOM "A")               ==> A
 (MAKE-ATOM "hi there")        ==> |hi there|
 (MAKE-ATOM "(F O O)")         ==> |(F O O)| ; Lists are never built.

 (SETQ A (MKATOM "FOO" NIL))   ==> FOO ; not interned.
 (SETQ B (MKATOM "FOO" T))     ==> FOO ; interned.
 (EQ A 'FOO)                   ==> NIL
 (EQ B 'FOO)                   ==> T

 (MKATOM "007" NIL NIL)     ==> |007| ; an uninterned symbol.
 (MKATOM "007" NIL T)       ==> 7     ; a fixnum.
 (MKATOM "007" T NIL)       ==> |007| ; an interned symbol.
 (MKATOM "007" T T)         ==> 7     ; a fixnum.
