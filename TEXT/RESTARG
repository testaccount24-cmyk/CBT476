Function: RESTARG

Syntax:   (RESTARG arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a compiled code object (SUBR or closure).

Returns:

 T or NIL, depending on whether the compiled code object specified by
 arg1 accepts &REST arguments.

Processing:

 RESTARG looks at the compiled code header information, extracts the
 restarg value therefrom, and returns T or NIL.

 Two ways to specify compiled code objects are:

 (1) (GET function-name 'SUBR) - which gets the current function
     definition provided that it has been loaded.
 (2) (ZILLOAD function-name)   - which loads the function from disk.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a compiled code object or closure.

Notes:

 This function was created for parallelism with MAXARGS and MINARGS.
 In particular, the ARGS function uses this internally.

 Functions that take keyword arguments are considered to take a
 &REST arg.

Examples:

 (APPEND (CAR NIL) NIL)         ==> NIL ; to load CAR and APPEND.
 (RESTARG (GET 'CAR 'SUBR))     ==> NIL ; after CAR has been used.
 (RESTARG (ZILLOAD 'GC))        ==> NIL
 (RESTARG (GET 'APPEND 'SUBR))  ==> T   ; after APPEND has been used.
 (RESTARG (ZILLOAD 'MAPCAR))    ==> T
