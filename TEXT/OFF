Macro: OFF

Syntax:   (OFF funspec)

 funspec (required, not evaluated) - a symbol funname, list (funname),
         or a list (funname aspect),
         where: funname is a symbol naming a function
                aspect is one of:  ENTRY, :ENTRY, EXIT, :EXIT

Returns:

 funname, after cancelling any outstanding AT specification for the
 function specified by funname and the aspect.

Processing:

 Any processing specified by a previous AT for the function and the
 aspect (entry or exit) is cancelled.  This results in reversion of
 the function's entry or exit processing to the default tracing
 behavior, which is to print "Entering" or "Exiting" and the
 argument or values list.

 If no aspect is given, it defaults to entry.

 If the function is not currently being traced, or there is no AT
 for that function, no action is taken.  Specifically, OFF does NOT
 remove tracing for the function; use UNTRACE for that purpose.


Errors signaled:

 Invalid function name.
 Invalid aspect (not entry or exit).

Notes:

 See also AT, TRACE, and UNTRACE.

 See member $TRACE of this document for a description of tracing,
 and for examples of use.

 See ZILTRACE for technical details on how tracing and untracing
 are effected.

Examples:

;(OFF FOO)
;(OFF (FOO ENTRY))
;(OFF (FOO :ENTRY))       all remove an AT breakpoint for FOO entry.
;
;(OFF (FOO EXIT))
;(OFF (FOO :EXIT))        all remove an AT breakpoint for FOO exit.
;
