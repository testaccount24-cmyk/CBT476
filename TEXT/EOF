Function: EOF

Syntax:   (EOF &optional file1)

 file1 (optional, evaluated) - an input file name.

Returns:

 T if end-of-file status has been reached on the input file specified
 by file1, else NIL.

Processing:

 If the end-of-file flag is on in the input file file1, T is returned;
 otherwise NIL is returned.

 A ZIL program or function should issue this function call while
 processing one or more READ/READCH/TYI calls to see if end-of-file has
 been reached, in order to prevent a "read after end of file" run-time
 error.  A NIL result returned by READ or READCH, or an "eofval" from
 TYI, should be ignored if the end-of-file flag is on for the file in
 question.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid input file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified input file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 If the QUIT function has been issued against the file, EOF will
 return T.

Examples:

 (EOF)
 (EOF NIL)    ...are equivalent.

 (EOF 'FOO)      returns T if end-of-file has been reached on FOO.
