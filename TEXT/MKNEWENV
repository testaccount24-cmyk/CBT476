Function: MKNEWENV

Syntax:   (MKNEWENV &optional arg1)

 arg1 (optional, evaluated) - a variable binding environment (alist).

Returns:

 A new evaluation environment which contains the variable binding
 environment specified by arg1 (or none), and default (null) entries
 for the other components of the environment.

Processing:

 MKNEWENV builds an evaluation environment which contains the
 variable binding environment specified by arg1 (or a null one if
 arg1 is omitted), and null entries for the other components.

 The variable binding environment is a LEXICAL one, not the
 SPECIAL (dynamic) variable binding environment.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 This is an internal ZIL function used by the evaluator to implement
 lexical scoping.  The format of an evaluation environment is
 system-dependent; however, the FUNENV function will return the
 environment component of an interpreted lexical closure if you're
 interested in knowing what an evaluation environment looks like in ZIL.
