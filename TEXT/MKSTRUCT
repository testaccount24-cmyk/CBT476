Function: MAKE-STRUCT

Syntax:   (MAKE-STRUCT arg1 arg2)
    or:   (MKSTRUCT arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a positive fixnum.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 A structure of (n) elements, where n is the value of arg1, and the
 type is arg2.

Processing:

 A structure is allocated with the number of elements specified by arg1, urned
 which must be a fixnum.  All of the elements are initialized to NIL
 except for the structure type, which is set to arg2.

 A length of 1 is valid, in which case the structure has no elements.

 The predicates VECP and STRUCTP are true of structures.

Errors signaled:

 Arg 1 not a positive fixnum.
 Arg 2 not a symbol.
 Not enough structure space to build the structure, even after GC.

Notes:

 MAKE-STRUCT and MKSTRUCT are equivalent and both acceptable names.

 Compare ZMSTRUCT, which makes a structure out of a list.

 MKSTRUCT is generally not to be used by the ZIL programmer.  Use
 DEFSTRUCT to define and manipulate structures.
