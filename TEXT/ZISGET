Function: ZISGET

Syntax:   (ZISGET arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a string (or symbol).

Returns:

 A string containing the value of the ISPF dialog variable whose name
 is arg1.

Processing:

 The ISPF VCOPY service is invoked to retrieve the value of the ISPF
 dialog variable whose name is specified by arg1.  Thus, the standard
 ISPF variable search takes place.

 The value is always returned as a string, regardless of how it is
 stored internally in the ISPF dialog.

 If the variable does not exist, a null string is returned.

 Naturally, ISPF must be active (see member ZISEXEC for details).

 You will need to use this function to access the values of dialog
 variables updated by such services as VGET, DISPLAY, and table
 services.

 To update the value of an ISPF dialog variable, use the ZISPUT
 function.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid ISPF dialog variable name (not a string or symbol of from 1
 to 8 characters in length).

 ISPF dialog services not available; either ZIL is running outside
 of ISPF or it is running under the TSO Authorized Service Facility
 or other environment where ISPF dialog services are temporarily
 unavailable.

 ISPF dialog error (return code 20) returned from the VCOPY service.

Notes:

 ISPF Version 2 must be installed to use this function.

 Unless CONTROL ERRORS RETURN is active, a VCOPY service that fails
 will terminate ZIL entirely.

Examples:

 (ZISEXEC "vget (foo) profile") puts the value of foo in the function
pool, but does not yet make it available to ZIL.

 (ZISGET 'foo) or (ZISGET "foo") returns the value of the ISPF dialog
variable foo.
