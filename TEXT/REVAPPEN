Function: REVAPPEND

Syntax:   (REVAPPEND list1 list2)
    or:   (REVAPPEN list1 list2)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.
 list2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally a list.

Returns:

 A list consisting of the elements of argument 1 in reverse order
 followed by the elements of argument 2.

Processing:

 (REVAPPEND X Y) is equivalent to (APPEND (REVERSE X) Y), in particular
 with respect to the fact that the first argument is copied, not
 destroyed.

 Compare NRECONC, which destructively alters the first argument.

Errors signaled:

 list1 not a proper list.

Notes:

 As a special case, (REVAPPEND atom NIL), where atom is not a list,
 returns the selfsame atom.


Examples:

 (REVAPPEND NIL NIL)         ==> NIL
 (REVAPPEND NIL '(A B C))    ==> (A B C)
 (REVAPPEND '(A B C) NIL)    ==> (C B A)
 (REVAPPEND '(A) '(B))       ==> (A B)
 (REVAPPEND '(A) 'B)         ==> (A . B)
 (REVAPPEND '(A B) '(C D))   ==> (B A C D)
 (REVAPPEND '(A B C) 'D)     ==> (C B A . D)

;The following shows how the second argument to REVAPPEND is NOT copied.

 (SETQ X '(A B))             ==> (A B)
 (SETQ Y '(C D))             ==> (C D)
 (SETQ Z (REVAPPEND X Y))    ==> (B A C D)
 (EQ (CDDR Z) Y)             ==> T
