Macro: TTAB

Syntax:   (TTAB arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 A fixnum containing the sum of arg1 plus 1, which is used to update the
 current character pointer of the output file specified by arg2.

Processing:

 The ZPUTFPO function is invoked to update the current character
 pointer.  The value specified in the TTAB function is a zero-based
 offset, which is transformed into a 1-based column specification
 by the macro expansion.

 See ZPUTFPO for more information.

Errors signaled:

 Errors detected by ZPUTFPO and ADD1 (q.v.).

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 Use of an out-of-range value as the first argument may cause
 serious errors in the ZIL environment.  Do so with extreme caution.

 The following examples illustrate the macro expansion for TTAB:

 (TTAB 3 FILE) --> (ZPUTFPO 4 FILE)
 (TTAB N FILE) --> (ZPUTFPO (ADD1 N) FILE)

Examples:

 (TTAB 0) and (TTAB 0 NIL) are equivalent, and permit the current
             line of standard output to be overlaid with new data.

 (TTAB 9 'FOO)  sets the current column of output file FOO to 10.
