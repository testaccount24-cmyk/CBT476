Macro: SASSQ

Syntax:   (SASSQ arg1 alist2 fun3)

 arg1   (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 alist2 (required, evaluated) - a list in association list format
                                (i.e. a list of dotted pairs).
 fun3   (required, evaluated) - a function of no arguments.

Returns:

 The first dotted pair in alist2 whose CAR matches arg1;
 the result of invoking fun3 if no such pair exists.

Processing:

 Same as for ASSQ, except that if no matching pair is found, fun3 is
 executed.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Since this is a macro that expands into a call to ASSQ, it uses
 whatever equality test ASSQ uses.   See ASSQ for more information.
