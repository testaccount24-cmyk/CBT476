 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a file object.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.

 arg5 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

 The appropriate value, depending on the caller.

Processing:

 ZCREAD is the low-level function that invokes the "current ZIL
 reader" (as opposed to ZDREAD, the "default ZIL reader").

 See $READER for information about how to specify the function to
 be used as the "current ZIL reader", and how it is used.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 You generally would not call ZCREAD directly.  ZCREAD exists only
 for the purpose of defining the standard ZIL input functions.

Examples:

  See $READER for examples.
