Function: ZILUNBND

Syntax:   (ZILUNBND)

Returns:

 An object known as the "unbound marker".                               .

Processing:

 An internal object called the "unbound marker" is used by ZIL to
 indicate variables that have SPECIAL bindings with no value, or
 to initialize the value/binding cells of symbols that have no
 global value.

 Since the "unbound marker" looks like a list to ZIL whose CAR and
 CDR point to itself, it is possible to test any binding for
 valuelessness by testing the CDR of the binding for EQness to
 (ZILUNBND).

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:
