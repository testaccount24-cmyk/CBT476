Function: ZCADDDR

Syntax:   (ZCADDDR list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a list.

Returns:

 The ZCAR of the CDR of the CDR of the CDR of list1.

Processing:

 In effect, this function returns the fourth element of a list.

 This function is identical to CADDDR, except that it is an error if the
 CDDDR of the argument is NIL.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 This function may be used to generate very efficient compiled code when
 it is known that the CDDDR of the argument will never be NIL.

Examples:

 (ZCADDDR '(A B C D E)) ==> D
