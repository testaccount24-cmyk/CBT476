 IMPLODE, CONCAT and MAKNAM.  Note that some of these functions create
 interned symbols and some created uninterned ones.

 NIL is also a symbol.

 None.

 (SYMBOLP 'FOO)     ==> T
 (SYMBOLP NIL)      ==> T
 (SYMBOLP 123)      ==> NIL

 (SYMBOLP '12)      ==> NIL
 (SYMBOLP (GENSYM)) ==> T
 (SYMBOLP '\12)     ==> T
