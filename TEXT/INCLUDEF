Macro: INCLUDEF

Syntax:   (INCLUDEF dsn1)

 dsn1  (required, evaluated) - a data set name (string or symbol).

Returns:

 NIL, after including all the forms in the dataset specified by dsn1.

Processing:

 INCLUDEF is a macro which allows you to include LISP source code from
 another data set into other code; it expands into a PROGN containing
 all the forms from the data set, with NIL as the last value.

 READ errors do not terminate the operation.

Errors signaled:

 Errors detected by OPEN and READ.

Notes:

 INCLUDEF can be used under the compiler to incorporate source code
 (e.g. macro definitions) only in locations that are subject to
 macroexpansion.  Under the interpreter, INCLUDEF functions
 similarly to LOAD.

 Compare INCLUDE, which is identical to INCLUDEF except that it
 does not evaluate its argument.

 The function XINCLUDE, which underlies INCLUDE and INCLUDEF,
 performs the actual expansion (i.e. it returns a PROGN list made
 from the contents of the file).  Direct use of XINCLUDE, while
 not recommended, may be useful in certain situations.
