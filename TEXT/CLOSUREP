Function: CLOSUREP

Syntax:   (CLOSUREP arg1)

 arg1 (required,evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is a compiled closure, otherwise NIL.

Processing:

 A compiled closure is the result of compiling the special form
 (FUNCTION ...); this creates an object consisting of a pointer to
 compiled subroutine code and a pointer to the environment current at
 the time the closure was created.

 Compiled closures may be executed directly by ZILXSUB or ZILXFUN, but
 they are generally passed to APPLY or FUNCALL.
 In addition, they can be specified as the CAR of a list passed to EVAL.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The FUNCTION special form in the interpretive environment
 does not create a CLOSUREP form; rather, it creates an object
 called a FUNARG (interpreted lexical closure).  The predicate
 FUNARGP returns T for such an object.

Examples:

 (CLOSUREP 'CAR)           ==> NIL
 (CLOSUREP (FUNCTION CAR)) ==> NIL ; in the interpretive environment
;(CLOSUREP (FUNCTION CAR)) ==> T ; compiled
 (CLOSUREP (ZILLOAD 'CAR)) ==> NIL
 (SETF (PLIST 'FOO) NIL)   ==> NIL ; dummy to initialize SETF setup
 (CLOSUREP (GET 'CAR 'SETFMETHOD)) ==> T
