Macro: INCF

Syntax:   (INCF place1 &optional increment2)

 place1 (required) - a form acceptable to SETF which evaluates to a
                     number.
 increment2 (optional, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 place1, after it has been incremented by increment2.

Processing:

 place1 is typically a variable, but in general is any form acceptable
 as the first argument to SETF.
 The variable or location specified by place1 is incremented by adding
 to it the value of increment2, which defaults to 1 if not specified.

Errors signaled:

 None by the macro, but the increment will fail if bad args are used.

Notes:

 Compare DECF, which decrements.

 INCF is a macro that expands something like this:

  (INCF a b)  --> (SETF a (+ a b))

Examples:

 (SETQ A 1)   ==> 1
 (INCF A)     ==> 2
 A            ==> 2
 (INCF A 3)   ==> 5
 A            ==> 5
 (INCF A -1)  ==> 4
 A            ==> 4
