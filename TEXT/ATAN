Function: ATAN

Syntax:   (ATAN num1 num2)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.
 num2 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the arctangent of num2/num1 in radians.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the value
 from num1.  If num1 and num2 are both single-precision flonums, or one
 is an integer and the other is a single-precision flonum, the result is
 a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is a double-precision
 flonum.

Errors signaled:

 num1 or num2 not numeric.
 num1 and num2 may not both be zero.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

 Bignums are not supported as arguments to this function.

Examples:

 (ATAN 0     1)      ==> 0.0
 (ATAN 0     1.0F0)  ==> 0.0F0
 (ATAN 0     1.0)    ==> 0.0

 (ATAN 0.0F0 1)      ==> 0.0F0
 (ATAN 0.0F0 1.0F0)  ==> 0.0F0
 (ATAN 0.0F0 1.0)    ==> 0.0

 (ATAN 0.0   1)      ==> 0.0
 (ATAN 0.0   1.0F0)  ==> 0.0
 (ATAN 0.0   1.0)    ==> 0.0

 (ATAN 0 1)   ==> 0.0
 (ATAN 1 0)   ==> 1.57079632
 (ATAN 1 1)   ==> 0.78539816
 (ATAN -1 -1) ==> -2.35619449
 (ATAN 1 -1)  ==> 2.35619449

 (ATAN 0 0)   ==> ("***ERROR***")
