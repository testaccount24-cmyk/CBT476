Function: RMINIT

Syntax:   (RMINIT)

Returns:

 NIL, after restoring the read table to its default mode of operation.

Processing:

 The read table is reset to its initial status, cancelling any
 user-defined reader macros and re-establishing the standard meanings
 for all characters.  This includes the forward and backward slash
 characters / and \, which may have been changed by the RMMAC function.
 the same as the backslash \ character, i.e. as a single escape.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 If you use this to cancel RMMAC, you lose all your reader macro
 definitions that you changed.  Too bad.
