Function: FIXP

Syntax:   (FIXP arg1)

 arg1 (required,evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is an integer (fixnum or bignum), otherwise NIL.

Processing:

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 FIXP is identical to INTEGERP; in fact, INTEGERP is the preferred
 predicate, since its meaning is unambiguous with respect to bignums.

 A fixnum is an integer in the range -2147483648 thru 2147483647.
 Integers outside of this range are bignums, of which BIGP is true.
 The predicate FIXNUMP may be used to test if an object is an
 integer (fixnum or bignum).

Examples:

 (FIXP 1)               ==> T
 (FIXP 1.0)             ==> NIL
 (FIXP 1.0F0)           ==> NIL
 (FIXP '(1))            ==> NIL
 (FIXP 'ONE)            ==> NIL
 (FIXP 123456789876)    ==> T
 (FIXP (** 2 31))       ==> T
