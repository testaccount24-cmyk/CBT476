Function: SETDEBUG

Syntax:   (SETDEBUG arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.

Returns:

 arg1, after setting ZIL debugging mode on or off.

Processing:

 If arg1 is NIL, the flag that controls debugging mode is set off.
 Otherwise, the flag that controls debugging mode is set on.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Currently, debugging mode means that if a ZIL function signals an
 error, a traceback of the push down stack will be printed on the
 standard output file.  No interactive debugging environment exists yet.

Examples:

 (SETDEBUG T) enables debugging mode.
 (SETDEBUG NIL) disables debugging mode.
