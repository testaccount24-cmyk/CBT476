Function: SYMBOL-PLIST

Syntax:   (SYMBOL-PLIST arg1)
    or:   (PLIST arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 The property list of arg1.

Processing:

 If arg1 has no property list, NIL is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 SYMBOL-PLIST and PLIST are both acceptable names, for compatibility
 with both Common LISP and Maclisp.

 See member $PROP for information about property lists.

Examples:

 (prog ()
  (SETQ A (GENSYM))

 (PLIST A)              ==> NIL

 (GET A 'FOO)           ==> NIL
 (GET A 'BAZ)           ==> NIL

 (PUTPROP A 'BAR 'FOO)  ==> BAR

 (PLIST A)              ==> (FOO BAR)

 (GET A 'FOO)           ==> BAR
 (GET A 'BAZ)           ==> NIL

 (PUTPROP A '(FROB NICK ATE) 'BAZ)  ==> (FROB NICK ATE)

 (PLIST A)              ==> (BAZ (FROB NICK ATE) FOO BAR)

 (GET A 'FOO)           ==> BAR
 (GET A 'BAZ)           ==> (FROB NICK ATE)

 (REMPROP A 'FOO)       ==> BAR

 (PLIST A)              ==> (BAZ (FROB NICK ATE))

 (GET A 'FOO)           ==> NIL
 (GET A 'BAZ)           ==> (FROB NICK ATE)
