Function: ZILSPRT

Syntax:   (ZILSPRT arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a compiled code SUBR object.

Returns:

 arg1, after assigning the compiled code SUBR specified by arg1 as the
 "current ZIL printer".

Processing:

 The SUBR specified by arg1 is made the "current ZIL printer" by
 having its address inserted in the field which is used by ZCPRINT
 to access the current ZIL printer.

 See $PRINTER for information about how to specify the function to
 be used as the "current ZIL printer", and how it is used.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument.

Notes:

 A SUBR compiled code object is a value that is returned only by the
 ZILLOAD function.  Closures, whether compiled or interpreted, are not
 permitted by ZILSPRT; use SETPRT to define the "current ZIL printer"
 using an arbitrary form that can be funcalled.

Examples:

;   (ZILSPRT (ZILLOAD 'ZMSPRINT))
;
;   or (ZILSPRT (SUBR ZMSPRINT)) under the compiler,
;
; makes the Maclisp-compatible Macsyma print functions active
; (i.e. the ones that are sensitive to the special variables
; ¬R and ¬W).
