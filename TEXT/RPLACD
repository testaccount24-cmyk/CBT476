Function: RPLACD

Syntax:   (RPLACD arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a cons (list or dotted pair).
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The first argument, with its CDR replaced by the second argument.

Processing:

 The second argument destructively replaces the CDR of the first
 argument; i.e. the first argument becomes a CONS of the CAR of the
 first argument and the second argument, but without obtaining
 a new cell.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 As with all the "destructive" functions, RPLACD should not be used
 on an in-line compiled list, i.e. a list derived from compiling the
 construct (QUOTE (form1 form2 ...)).  This will cause further
 references to the in-line constant list to be incorrect.

Examples:

 (SETQ X '(A B C D))  ==> (A B C D)
 X                    ==> (A B C D)

 (RPLACD X '(E F))    ==> (A E F)
 X                    ==> (A E F)

;Note that the value of X has been altered.
