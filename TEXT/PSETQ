Macro: PSETQ

Syntax:   (PSETQ &rest args)

 args occur in pairs: arg1 and arg2.

 arg1 (required, not evaluated) - a symbol.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The last argument, after the variables specified by the odd-numbered
 arguments have been bound to the values specified by the
 even-numbered arguments.

Processing:

 The values of the even-numbered arguments are obtained, and then the
 variables represented by the odd-numbered arguments are set to these
 values respectively.  This is similar to SETQ, except for the fact
 that the assignments are in parallel.  Thus, the value of a given
 argument does not depend on a prior assignment that takes place
 in the same PSETQ form.

 See SETQ for details on variable binding.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid syntax (an even number of arguments required).
 Invalid first argument.

Notes:

 See SETQ for details on variable binding.

Examples:

 (LET ((A 1) (B 2) (C 3))
      (SETQ A 0 B A C B)
      (LIST A B C))        ==>  (0 0 0)

 (LET ((A 1) (B 2) (C 3))
      (PSETQ A 0 B A C B)
      (LIST A B C))        ==>  (0 1 2)
