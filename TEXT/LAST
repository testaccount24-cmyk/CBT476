Function: LAST

Syntax:   (LAST arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 The last sublist of the list specified by arg1.

Processing:

 Successive sublists (CDR's) of the list are examined until the one with
 a single element (i.e. one whose own CDR is NIL or atomic) is found;
 then that sublist is returned.

 If the list ends in a dotted pair, the returned value is that
 dotted pair; otherwise the returned value is a list of one element.

 If arg1 is NIL or atomic, itself is returned.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

Examples:

 (LAST NIL)                  ==> NIL
 (LAST '(A))                 ==> (A)
 (LAST '(A B . C))           ==> (B . C)
 (LAST '(A B C D))           ==> (D)
 (LAST '((A B) (C D)))       ==> ((C D))
