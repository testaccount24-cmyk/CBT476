Function: ZEVDVAR

Syntax:   (ZEVDVAR arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a list.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - T or NIL.

Returns:

 The first element of arg1 (which DEFVAR returns).

Processing:

 This function implements DEFVAR at run time.  arg1 is the argument
 list passed to DEFVAR, with the CAR being the variable name.

 arg2 specifies whether DEFVAR is being invoked at "top level" (T)
 or not (NIL).

 See DEFVAR for more information.

Errors signaled:

 DEFVAR syntax errors (invalid arg1).
 Not at top level (arg2 is NIL).

Notes:

 ZEVDVAR is used only by DEFVAR under the interpreter.  Compiled calls
 to DEFVAR in MODULE's use ZEVXVAR, which ZEVDVAR interfaces to.

 There is a macro XDEFVAR, which can be used to invoke DEFVAR at run
 time (similarly to XDEFUN and XDEFMACRO).  The syntax is identical to
 that of DEFVAR.  XDEFVAR expands into a call to ZEVXVAR (not ZEVDVAR).
