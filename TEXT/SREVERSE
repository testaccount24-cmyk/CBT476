Function: STRING-REVERSE

Syntax:   (STRING-REVERSE arg1)
    or:   (SREVERSE arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a string.

Processing:

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a string.

Notes:

 As for many functions that take strings as arguments, symbols are
 permitted; their print names are used in that case.  However, this
 function always returns a string.

Examples:

 (STRING-REVERSE "")               ==> ""
 (STRING-REVERSE "A")              ==> "A"
 (STRING-REVERSE "foo")            ==> "oof"
 (STRING-REVERSE 'FOOBAR)          ==> "RABOOF" ; note - a string!
