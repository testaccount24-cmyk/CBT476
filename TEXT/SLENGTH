Function: STRING-LENGTH

Syntax:   (STRING-LENGTH arg1)
    or:   (SLENGTH arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a string.

Returns:

 An integer containing the number of characters in the string specified
 by arg1; i.e. the length of the string.

Processing:

 The length of the string is returned as an integer.

 As for most string-handling functions, a symbol is accepted for the
 string argument; in this case the length of the print name of the
 symbol is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a string.

Notes:

Examples:

 (STRING-LENGTH "")    ==>  0
 (STRING-LENGTH "foo") ==>  3
 (STRING-LENGTH "\"")  ==>  1
 (STRING-LENGTH NIL)   ==>  3
