Function: PEEKB

Syntax:   (PEEKB arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.

Returns:

 A fixnum whose contents represent the contents of the BYTE of
 virtual storage at the memory location pointed to by arg1.

Processing:

 arg1 is interpreted as a 31-bit address and is used as a pointer to
 access active main storage.

 This function loads 1 BYTE and makes a fixnum out of it;
 compare PEEK, which returns a FULLWORD of storage.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a fixnum.

Notes:

 Currently this function does not check the validity of the address.
 Therefore, 0C4 ABENDs are likely when using this function.

Examples:

 (PEEKB 0)                     ==> 4         ; i.e. X'04'
