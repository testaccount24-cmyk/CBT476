Function: FIRSTN

Syntax:   (FIRSTN count1 list2)

 count1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 list2 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 A list of the first count1 elements of list list2.

Processing:

 If count1 is zero, NIL is returned.  Otherwise the elements (CAR's)    by
 of list2 are consed up to form a new list until count1 is exhausted.

 The length of the new list is the minimum of count1 and the length
 of list2.

Errors signaled:

 First argument not a fixnum, or is negative.
 Second argument not a proper list.

Notes:

 (FIRST1 n l) for n less than zero may be defined some day as returning
 the last n elements of l, but you can use NTHCDR for that.

Examples:

 (FIRSTN 0 '(A B C))      ==> NIL
 (FIRSTN 1 '(A B C))      ==> (A)
 (FIRSTN 2 '(A B C))      ==> (A B)
 (FIRSTN 3 '(A B C))      ==> (A B C)
 (FIRSTN 4 '(A B C))      ==> (A B C)
 (FIRSTN 5 '(A B C))      ==> (A B C)
