Function: ZGETFPO

Syntax:   (ZGETFPO &optional arg1)

 arg1 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 A fixnum representing the current character position of the
 output file specified by arg1.

Processing:

 The current character pointer is obtained from the file block and
 a fixnum is created from it.

 The value is a 1-based column value, and ranges from 1 to the logical
 line length of the output file, with the following exception:

 If the file is the standard output file (NIL), position 0 contains
 the current print control character.  This value may be returned
 by ZGETFPO if a previous ZPUTFPO set it to that value and no PRIN1,
 PRINT or TERPRI has been issued to that file.

 The first argument, if omitted, defaults to NIL, which represents
 the standard output file.

 The value of the current character pointer for an output file is
 altered implicitly by output functions like PRINC, PRIN1 and TERPRI,
 or explicitly by the ZPUTFPO function.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid output file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified output file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

Examples:

 (ZGETFPO) and (ZGETFPO NIL) are equivalent and return the current
           character pointer of the standard output file.

 (ZGETFPO 'FOO) returns the current character pointer of output file FOO
