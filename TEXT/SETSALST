Function: SETSALST

Syntax:   (SETSALST arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an association list
                              (a list of dotted pairs).

Returns:

 arg1, with the current SPECIAL variable binding environment set to it.

Processing:

 The current SPECIAL variable binding environment is replaced with arg1.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 SETSALST is used internally by ZIL in certain places and should be
 avoided by all other users.  Issuing SETSALST is extremely dangerous
 unless you really know what you are doing.

 (SETF (SPECIAL-ALIST) arg1) is the preferred way to express this,
 if you really want to do it.

 This function may or may not have the effect you want, depending
 on where you execute it from.  In any case, you definitely should
 not be using it if you're not a ZIL implementer.

Examples:

 (MAKUNBOUND 'A)           ==> A
 (BOUNDP 'A)               ==> NIL
 (SETSALST '((A . 1) (B . 2)))
                           ==> ((A . 1) (B . 2))

 (SPECIAL-ALIST)           ==> ((A . 1) (B . 2))
 (BOUNDP 'A)               ==> T
 A                         ==> 1
 (SETQ A 3)                ==> 3
 A                         ==> 3
 (SPECIAL-ALIST)           ==> ((A . 3) (B . 2))
