Function: PPTIME

Syntax:   (PPTIME &optional time1)

 time1 (optional, evaluated) - a list of 3 fixnums.

Returns:

 A string containing the time represented by time1 in "pretty" format.

Processing:

 If time1 is omitted, the current time is used.  Otherwise, time1 is
 assumed to be a list (hour minute second) in a format like that
 returned by CURTIME (CURRENT-TIME).

 The "second" (that is, the third item in the list) may be omitted,
 since it is not used.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid time.

Notes:

 See CURTIME for disclaimers.

Examples:

; (PPTIME)           ==> "5:30 P.M."         ; at 5:30 PM

  (PPTIME '(1 1 1))  ==> "1:01 A.M."
  (PPTIME '(0 0))  ==> "12:00 Mid."
  (PPTIME '(12 0))  ==> "12:00 Noon"
  (PPTIME '(0 1 2))  ==> "12:01 A.M."
  (PPTIME '(13 14))  ==> "1:14 P.M."
