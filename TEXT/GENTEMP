Function: GENTEMP

Syntax:   (GENTEMP &optional pfx1 arg2)

 pfx1 (optional, evaluated) - a string or symbol.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object (it is ignored).

Returns:

 A unique interned symbol whose print name consists of the "GENTEMP
 prefix" pfx1 concatenated with a number incremented sequentially by
 each invocation.

Processing:

 The GENTEMP counter (initially 0) is incremented and used to construct
 a symbol name, together with the GENTEMP prefix, and a symbol is built
 from these.  The counter is incremented until a symbol name is obtained
 that does not currently exist on the oblist (i.e. is not interned), and
 a new interned symbol with that name is created.

 The prefix, if not specified by pfx1, defaults to T.

 The second optional argument to GENTEMP is supported for compatibility
 with other LISP's, but it is not used in ZIL at this time.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid prefix.

Notes:

 Compare GENSYM, which creates uninterned symbols.  The differences
 between GENSYM and GENTEMP, other than the fact that GENTEMP symbols
 are interned, are that the GENTEMP counter does not include leading
 zeroes when the symbol name is built, and that the default prefix
 is different.

Examples:

 (GENTEMP)           ==> T1
 (GENTEMP)           ==> T2
 (SETQ A (GENTEMP))  ==> T3
 (EQ A 'T3)          ==> T   ; GENTEMP's are always interned.
 'T4                 ==> T4
 (GENTEMP)           ==> T5  ; GENTEMP skips over already-interned names
 (GENTEMP 'FOO)      ==> FOO6
 (GENTEMP "a")       ==> |a7|
 (GENTEMP)           ==> T8
