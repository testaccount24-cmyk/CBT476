Function: CAR

Syntax:   (CAR list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a list.

Returns:

 The first element of list1, or NIL if list1 is NIL.

Processing:

 If list1 is NIL, then NIL is returned.  Otherwise the contents of
 the CAR cell of list1 is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 There is a function ZCAR which is functionally identical to CAR
 except that (ZCAR NIL) is an error, and is not defined.  This may
 be used, particularly in compiled code, for speed when you know
 that the argument will never be NIL.  Note that erroneously passing
 NIL to ZCAR will not be detected in compiled code.

Examples:

 (CAR NIL)                ==> NIL
 (CAR '(A))               ==> A
 (CAR '(A B C D))         ==> A
 (CAR '((A1 A2) (B1 B2))) ==> (A1 A2)
 (CAR '(A . B))           ==> A
