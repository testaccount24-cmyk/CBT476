Function: FBOUNDP

Syntax:   (FBOUNDP arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

Returns:

 T or NIL, depending of whether the symbol specified by arg1 currently
 has a function definition.

Processing:

 The variable specified by arg1 must have one of the following:

  (1) a MACRO, EXPR or FEXPR definition, as assigned by DEFUN or
      DEFMACRO.

  (2) a SUBR definition, as assigned when a compiled code definition
      is loaded from the system library for this function.

  (3) a special form definition, as set up by the evaluator at
      initialization time.

 If it does, T is returned; otherwise the autoload process is invoked
 to attempt to locate a function definition.  If this process fails
 to make the function defined, NIL is returned.

 If the argument is not a symbol, a warning message is issued and NIL
 is returned.

 In the compiled environment, FBOUNDP may not be true of symbols which
 are the names of internally defined functions (functions which are
 only called from external compiled functions within a single compiled
 function source file).

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Remember that the argument to FBOUNDP is evaluated for its value.

 The form (DEFUN (function property) ... ) does NOT make "function"
 FBOUNDP.  That does not count as a function definition for the
 symbol.

Examples:

 (FBOUNDP 'CAR)             ==>  T
 (FBOUNDP 'COND)            ==>  T
 (FBOUNDP 'DO)              ==>  T
 (FBOUNDP 'NEW-FUNCTION)    ==>  NIL
 (DEFUN (NEW-FUNCTION SETFMETHOD) (A B) NIL) ==> NEW-FUNCTION
 (FBOUNDP 'NEW-FUNCTION)    ==>  NIL
 (DEFUN NEW-FUNCTION () T)  ==>  NEW-FUNCTION
 (FBOUNDP 'NEW-FUNCTION)    ==>  T
