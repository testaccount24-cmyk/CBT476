Function: COS

Syntax:   (COS num1)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the cosine of num1, where num1 is expressed in
 radians.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the
 value from num1.  If num1 is a single-precision flonum, the
 result is a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is
 a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument.
 For single precision, abs(arg) greater than 823549.5625.
 For double precision, abs(arg) greater than 3537118876014220.125.
 These values are the maximum that the FORTRAN subroutine library
 will successfully process.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

 Bignums are not supported as arguments to this function.


Examples:

(COS 0) ==> 1.0
(COS 1) ==> 0.54030230
(COS -1) ==> 0.54030230
(COS 0.5) ==> 0.87758256
(COS 0.5F0) ==> 0.8775826F0
