Function: ZILTRACE

Syntax:   (ZILTRACE arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - For TRACE and UNTRACE, a list of
                              function names (symbols).
                              For PP, a single function name (symbol).
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - one of the following symbols:
                              TRACE, UNTRACE, PP

Returns:

 If arg2 is TRACE or UNTRACE, whatever TRACE and UNTRACE are defined
 to return; if arg2 is PP, a LISP object which returns information
 about the function's original definition.

Processing:

 This function is invoked by the TRACE and UNTRACE macros to
 effect tracing and untracing, and by the ZILPP function and PP
 macro to obtain the definition of a function that is being traced.

 Information about traced functions is maintained as the value of
 the special variable *TRACE*, which is like an association list of
 traced functions.

Errors signaled:

 arg2 not one of the defined types.
 arg1 not a list of symbols (for TRACE and UNTRACE).
 arg1 not a symbol (for PP).

Notes:

 See member $TRACE of this document for a description of tracing and
 what kinds of functions can be traced.
