Function: LOG

Syntax:   (LOG num1 &optional base2)

 num1  (required, evaluated) - a number.
 base2 (optional, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the logarithm of num1, to the base base2 if base2 is
 specified, otherwise to the base E.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the value.
 If num1 is a single-precision flonum and base2 is omitted, or num1 and
 base2 are both single-precision flonums, or one is an integer and the
 other is a single-precision flonum, the result is a single-precision
 flonum; otherwise the result is a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument.
 num1 is zero or negative.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.
