Function: COPYENV

Syntax:   (COPYENV env1)

 env1 (required, evaluated) - an evaluation environment.

Returns:

 A new evaluation environment which is a copy of env1.

Processing:

 COPYENV builds an evaluation environment which contains the same
 components as env1.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 This is an internal ZIL function used by the evaluator to implement
 lexical scoping.  The format of an evaluation environment is
 system-dependent; however, the FUNENV function will return the
 environment component of an interpreted lexical closure if you're
 interested in knowing what an evaluation environment looks like in ZIL.
