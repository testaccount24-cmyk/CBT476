Function: LLKEYWDP

Syntax:   (LLKEYWDP arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is a "lambda list keyword", otherwise NIL.

Processing:

 A "lambda list keyword" is any symbol the first character of whose
 print name is an ampersand.  Lambda list keywords are exactly like
 other symbols, except that when they occur in lambda lists they
 have special meaning; they cannot represent variables.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 This is used by ZIL when it processes LAMBDA argument lists.

 The fact that a given symbol is LLKEYWDP does not necessarily mean
 that it is valid in a lambda list; an error is signalled if an
 symbol beginning with & appears in a lambda list that is not
 meaningful to ZIL (i.e. not &OPTIONAL, &REST, &AUX, etc.).

Examples:

 (LLKEYWDP 'FOO)       ==> NIL
 (LLKEYWDP 123)        ==> NIL
 (LLKEYWDP '&OPTIONAL) ==> T
 (LLKEYWDP '&FOO)      ==> T
 (LLKEYWDP '|&|)       ==> T
 (LLKEYWDP "&foo")     ==> NIL
 (LLKEYWDP '(&A B C))  ==> NIL
