Function: GETCHAR

Syntax:   (GETCHAR string1 index2)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.
 index2  (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.

Returns:

 The index2'th character of string1, as an interned symbol.

Processing:

 index2 is used as a one-based index into string1, where the characters
 of the string are indexed from 1 to the string length.

 The resultant character is made into a symbol which is always
 interned on the oblist.

 If index2 is less than 1 or greater than the length of the string,
 NIL is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid first argument (not a string).
 Invalid second argument (not a fixnum).

Notes:

 Observe the distinctions between the character extracting functions:

 GETCHAR   -  uses one-based indexing, returns a symbol.
 GETCHARN  -  uses one-based indexing, returns a fixnum.
 CHAR      -  uses zero-based indexing, returns a fixnum.

Examples:

 (GETCHAR "foo" 1)        ==> |f|
 (GETCHAR "foo" 0)        ==> NIL
 (GETCHAR "foo" 4)        ==> NIL
 (GETCHAR 'BAR 3)         ==> R
