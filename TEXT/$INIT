 INIT files are optional.

 You can create an INIT file to be loaded into ZIL when you start up.

 You may wish to include the MSGLEVEL function, as follows:

    (msglevel 0)   ; permits all messages to display
    (msglevel 1)   ; the default, suppresses informational messages.
    (msglevel 2)   ; suppresses informational and warning messages.
    (msglevel 3)   ; suppresses all messages (not recommended!).

 To control the display of garbage collection messages, try:

    (gcmsg nil)   ; suppresses all garbage collection messages
    (gcmsg t)     ; lets you see garbage collection messages

 Each form in the INIT file is evaluated and the result is printed.
 Because of this, you can include messages in the INIT file as
 strings, which evaluate to themselves and thus cause themselves
 to be printed as the INIT file is loaded.

 To suppress messages from INIT file forms, you can enclose them
 in a PROGN, of which the last form is the only one whose value
 will be printed.

 INIT files cannot be compiled.
