Function: SETPRT

Syntax:   (SETPRT arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a LISP object that can be invoked as a
                              function of 3 arguments.

Returns:

 A SUBR that implements the activation of the function specified by arg1
 as the "current ZIL printer".

Processing:

 The function specified by arg1 is made the "current ZIL printer" by
 having the address of a compiled SUBR wrapper inserted by ZILSPRT in
 the field which is used by ZCPRINT to access the current ZIL printer.
 This causes the function arg1 to be invoked as the "current ZIL
 printer".

 See $PRINTER for information about how to specify the function to
 be used as the "current ZIL printer", and how it is used.

Errors signaled:

 None (but beware of errors in your printer function!!!!!!!).

Notes:

 This is the general interface to setting the "current ZIL printer".
 Performance-conscious applications should use ZILSPRT and create a
 compiled code SUBR to be the "current ZIL printer".

Examples:

;   (SETPRT #'(LAMBDA (A B C) (ZMSPRINT A B C)))
;
; makes the Maclisp-compatible Macsyma print functions active
; (i.e. the ones that are sensitive to the special variables
; ¬R and ¬W).  However, ZILSPRT is the recommended way to do this.
