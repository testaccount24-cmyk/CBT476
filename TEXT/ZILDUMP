Function: ZILDUMP

Syntax:   (ZILDUMP arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a number or string.

Returns:

 A string containing a hexadecimal representation of arg1.

Processing:

 If arg1 is a fixnum, a string of 8 hex characters representing the
 fullword integer value is returned.

 If arg1 is a bignum, a list of ZILDUMPed integers is returned
 representing the 31-bit "bigits" that make up the bignum.  The
 list is isomorphic to that returned by BIGLIST (q.v.).  See member
 $BIGNUM for more information about the internals of bignums.

 If arg1 is a single-float, a string of 8 hex characters representing
 the contents of the fullword containing the IBM/370 floating-point
 value is returned.  The first 2 hex characters represent the
 characteristic and the rest represent the mantissa.

 If arg1 is a DOUBLE-float, a string of 16 hex characters representing
 the contents of the doubleword containing the IBM/370 floating-point
 value is returned.  The first 2 hex characters represent the
 characteristic and the rest represent the mantissa.

 If arg1 is a string, a string of hex characters representing the
 EBCDIC contents of the string is returned.  The number of characters
 in the value is, of course, 2 times the length of the arg1 string.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a number or a string.

Notes:

 This differs from using FORMAT to convert an integer to hex.

Examples:

 (ZILDUMP 1)             ==> "00000001"
 (ZILDUMP 4095)          ==> "00000FFF"
 (ZILDUMP -1)            ==> "FFFFFFFF"
 (ZILDUMP 2147483648)    ==> ("00000000" "00000001")
 (ZILDUMP -2147483648)   ==> "80000000"
 (ZILDUMP 1.0D0)         ==> "4110000000000000"
 (ZILDUMP 1.0F0)         ==> "41100000"
 (ZILDUMP "foo")         ==> "869696"
 (ZILDUMP " ")           ==> "40"
