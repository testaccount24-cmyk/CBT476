Function: SQRT

Syntax:   (SQRT num1)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the square root of num1.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the
 value from num1.  If num1 is a single-precision flonum, the
 result is a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is
 a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

 Argument is negative or not a number.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

 Bignums are not supported as arguments to this function.


Examples:

(SQRT 9)     ==> 3.0

(SQRT 1.5)   ==> 1.22474487
(SQRT 1.5F0) ==> 1.2247448F0
(SQRT 2)     ==> 1.41421356
(SQRT 2.0)   ==> 1.41421356
(SQRT 2.0F0) ==> 1.4142132F0
