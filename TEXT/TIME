Macro: TIME

Syntax:   (TIME &rest forms)

 form (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The value of the last form, after printing out the CPU time and GC time
 (if any) required to evaluate all the forms.

Processing:

 The current run time and GC time are saved, then the forms are
 evaluated in sequence, then the difference between the run time
 and GC time are computed and displayed.  Thus, you can use this
 form to show how much CPU time and/or GC time it takes for a
 particular operation or operations.

Errors signaled:

 None.  If any of the forms error out during evaluation, you still
 get the time displayed.

Notes:

 The run time shown does not include the GC time if any.

 For best results, you should execute the forms at least once before
 timing them.  In that way load time is not a factor.
