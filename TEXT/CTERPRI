Function: CTERPRI

Syntax:   (CTERPRI &optional file1)

 file1 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 T or NIL, depending on whether there is data on the current line
 of the output file specified by file1.

Processing:

 Each invocation of CTERPRI causes a line to be written out to the
 specified output file if and only if there is data on the current
 output line (T is returned as the value).  If no data has been
 written to the current line, no operation is performed (NIL is
 returned in that case).

 The current character position is reset to 1 when CTERPRI is issued,
 and the output line is cleared to blanks.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid output file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified output file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 CTERPRI invokes TERPRI to write out the current output line.
 See TERPRI for more information.

 See member $PRINTER for more information on printing functions.

Examples:

 (CTERPRI)
 (CTERPRI NIL) ...are equivalent and return NIL after writing the
                 current line of standard output, if it is not empty.

 (CTERPRI 'FOO) ...writes out the contents of the current line of
                  output file FOO, if there is any data on it.
