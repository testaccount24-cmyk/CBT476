Function: FIX

Syntax:   (FIX arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 The argument converted to an integer.

Processing:

 If the argument is float, the nearest integer less than or equal to
 the argument is returned.

 If the argument is integer, itself is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument.

Notes:

 Compare ROUND, which rounds its argument to the nearest integer;
 CEILING, which returns the nearest integer greater than or equal to its
 argument; and TRUNCATE, which returns the integer part of the flonum.
 FIX is identical to FLOOR in ZIL 1.3.

 Note that flonums whose exponent is large (in either direction) may
 result in integers whose value does not accurately represent the
 integer part of the flonum.
