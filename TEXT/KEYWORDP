Function: KEYWORDP

Syntax:   (KEYWORDP arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is a "keyword", otherwise NIL.

Processing:

 In Common LISP, a "keyword" is a symbol interned in the keyword
 package, and is printed with a leading colon.

 ZIL does not support packages, so a symbol is considered to be a
 keyword if the first character in its print name is a colon.
 Keyword symbols always evaluate to themselves.

 A keyword symbol cannot be used in a LAMBDA list or other variable
 binding environment, nor can it be SETQ'd.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 This is truly a kludge, but necessary to implement a minimal kind
 of support for functions with keyword arguments.

Examples:

 (KEYWORDP 'FOO)    ==> NIL
 (KEYWORDP NIL)     ==> NIL
 (KEYWORDP 123)     ==> NIL
 (KEYWORDP '(A B C)) ==> NIL
 (KEYWORDP ':FOO)   ==> T
 (KEYWORDP '|:|)    ==> T
 (KEYWORDP ":foo")  ==> NIL
