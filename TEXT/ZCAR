Function: ZCAR

Syntax:   (ZCAR list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a non-null list.

Returns:

 The first element of list1.

Processing:

 Like CAR, except that (ZCAR NIL) is not defined and is an error.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 This function may be used to generate very efficient compiled code when
 it is known that the argument will never be NIL.

Examples:

 (ZCAR '(A))               ==> A
 (ZCAR '(A B C D))         ==> A
 (ZCAR '((A1 A2) (B1 B2))) ==> (A1 A2)
 (ZCAR '(A . B))           ==> A

;(ZCAR NIL)  is an error
