Function: ZGETFPI

Syntax:   (ZGETFPI &optional arg1)

 arg1 (optional, evaluated) - an input file name.

Returns:

 A fixnum representing the current character position of the
 input file specified by arg1.

Processing:

 The current character pointer is obtained from the file block and
 a fixnum is created from it.

 The value is a 1-based column value, and ranges from 1 to the logical
 line length of the input file.

 If end-of-line is currently true of the file, -1 is returned.

 The first argument, if omitted, defaults to NIL, which represents
 the standard input file.

 The value of the current character pointer for an input file is
 altered implicitly by input functions like READ, READCH and TYI,
 or explicitly by the ZPUTFPI function.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid input file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified input file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

Examples:

 (ZGETFPI) and (ZGETFPI NIL) are equivalent and return the current
           character pointer of the standard input file.

 (ZGETFPI 'FOO) returns the current character pointer of input file FOO.
