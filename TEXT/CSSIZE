Function: CSSIZE

Syntax:   (CSSIZE)

Returns:

 An integer containing the total number of BYTES (not cells) in
 CONS space.

Notes:

 This value may be specified via the PARM field, or in a DECLARE,
 when a ZIL "program" is run.  See members $PARM and DECLARE of
 this documentation for more information.

 Do not confuse this function with ACSIZE, which returns the total
 number of bytes in currently active CONS space.  CSSIZE returns
 the maximum amount of CONS space allocated that may be called upon
 to be in use, provided that enough CONS cells are used up after a
 certain number of garbage collections.
