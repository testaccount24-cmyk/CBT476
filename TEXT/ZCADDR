Function: ZCADDR

Syntax:   (ZCADDR list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a list.

Returns:

 The ZCAR of the CDR of the CDR of list1.

Processing:

 In effect, this returns the third element of a list.

 This function is identical to CADDR, except that it is an error if the
 CDDR of the argument is NIL.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 This function may be used to generate very efficient compiled code when
 it is known that the CDDR of the argument will never be NIL.

Examples:

 (ZCADDR '(A B C D E))  ==> C
