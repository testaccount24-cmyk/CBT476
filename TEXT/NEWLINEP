Function: NEWLINEP

Syntax:   (NEWLINEP arg1)

 arg1 (optional, evaluated) - an input file name.

Returns:

 T if end-of-line status has been reached on the input file specified
 by arg1, else NIL.

Processing:

 If the newline flag is on in the input file specified by arg1,
 T is returned; otherwise NIL is returned.

 A ZIL program or function should issue this function call while
 processing one or more READCH or TYI calls to see if end-of-line has
 been reached, especially if characters are to be processed without
 regard to end-of-line conditions.  A NIL result returned by READCH may
 be caused by either end-of-file or end-of-line; the EOF and NEWLINEP
 functions should be used to test for these.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid input file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified input file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See READCH and TYI for more information on end-of-file and end-of-line
 conditions.

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 READCH, READLINE, TYI, and ZILRDCH are currently the only functions
 that set NEWLINEP to true.  ENDREAD will not do this; it will only
 cause a subsequent READCH, etc. to detect end-of-line and return NIL,
 at which point NEWLINEP will be true.

Examples:

 (NEWLINEP)
 (NEWLINEP NIL) ...are equivalent.

 (NEWLINEP 'FOO) returns T if end-of-line has been reached on FOO.
