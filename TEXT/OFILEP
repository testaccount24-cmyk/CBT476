Function: OFILEP

Syntax:   (OFILEP file1)

 file1 (required, evaluated) - a file name.

Returns:

 T if file1 is a valid output file, else NIL.

Processing:

 If the file specified by the first argument is an already open output
 file, then T is returned.  If the file is not an already open output
 file, then an attempt is made to open the file name consisting of
 'ZILO' + the file name, as for all ZIL file accessing functions.
 If such a file exists, T is returned; otherwise NIL is returned.
 If any error occurs trying to process the file, the error is
 signalled; in other words, OFILEP suppresses "file does not exist"
 errors only.

Errors signaled:

 See above description.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 Because an MVS file (ddname) allocation remains around even after
 the file is closed under ZIL, issuing OFILEP against a closed
 output file will cause the file to be reopened.

Examples:

 (OFILEP NIL)    will always return T.

 (OFILEP 'FOO)   returns T if a ddname ZILOFOO is allocated to a
                 usable data set.

 (OFILEP (OPEN "foo.data" 'out))     should return T.
