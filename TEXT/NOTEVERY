Function: NOTEVERY

Syntax:   (NOTEVERY arg1 arg2 ... argn)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a function that can be APPLY'ed.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - a proper list.
 argn (optional, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 T if any of the values produced by applying the first argument
 function to successive elements (CAR's) of the other argument lists
 is NIL, else NIL.

Processing:

 The function specified by the first argument is applied to each of the
 elements (CAR's) of the lists specified by the other arguments, until
 one of the lists is exhausted (in which case NOTEVERY returns NIL)
 or a null value is produced by this application (in which case NOTEVERY
 returns T).

 If no lists are specified, NOTEVERY returns NIL.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Compare SOME, EVERY, NOTANY, and the mapping functions.

Examples:

 (NOTEVERY #'INTEGERP NIL)           ==> NIL
 (NOTEVERY #'INTEGERP '(A B C D E))  ==> T
 (NOTEVERY #'INTEGERP '(1 2 3 4 5))  ==> NIL
 (NOTEVERY #'INTEGERP '(A 2 3 4 5))  ==> T
 (NOTEVERY #'INTEGERP '(1 2 3 4 E))  ==> T
 (NOTEVERY #'INTEGERP '(A B 3 D E))  ==> T
 (NOTEVERY #'EQ '(A B C) '(A B C D)) ==> NIL
 (NOTEVERY #'EQ '(X B C) '(A B C D)) ==> T
 (NOTEVERY #'EQ '(X Y Z) '(A B C D)) ==> T
 (NOTEVERY #'EQ '(A B Z) '(A B C D)) ==> T
