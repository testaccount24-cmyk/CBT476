Function: LOGBITP

Syntax:   (LOGBITP arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a non-negative integer.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - an integer.

Returns:

 T or NIL, depending on whether the arg1'th bit (counting from the
 right and starting with zero) is a 1 in arg2.

Processing:

 This is an integer-only operation.
 arg1 is a bitwise "index" into arg2 (i.e. arg1 signifies the bit
 that is on in the integer (expt 2 arg1).  If the corresponding bit
 in arg2 is on, then T is returned, else NIL is returned.

 If arg2 is negative, a two's-complement representation of arg2 is
 used to determine the bit setting.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a non-negative integer.
 arg2 not a integer.

Notes:

Examples:

 (LOGBITP 0 1)            ==> T
 (LOGBITP 1 1)            ==> NIL
 (LOGBITP 2 1)            ==> NIL
 (LOGBITP 0 2)            ==> NIL
 (LOGBITP 1 2)            ==> T
 (LOGBITP 2 1)            ==> NIL
 (LOOP FOR I FROM 0 TO 31 COUNT (LOGBITP I 0))    ==> 0
 (LOOP FOR I FROM 0 TO 31 COUNT (LOGBITP I -1))   ==> 32
