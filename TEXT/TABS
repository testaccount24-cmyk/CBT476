Function: TABS

Syntax:   (TABS arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 arg1, after tabs mode has been set on or off for the output file
 specified by arg2.

Processing:

 If arg1 is NIL, tabs mode is set off for output file arg2.
 Otherwise, tabs mode is set on for output file arg2.

 Tabs mode controls how the ZIL printer handles the following characters
 in a PRINC-style print request:

   X'05'   (horizontal tab)
   X'0D'   (carriage return)
   X'15'   (newline)
   X'AD'   (left square bracket)
   X'BD'   (right square bracket)

 If tabs mode is off, these characters are written to the output file
 just like any other character (subject to minimal character
 translation if a terminal is the destination to prevent terminal
 errors).

 If tabs mode is on, then the tab character causes tabbing to occur
 based on a tab size of 8 positions, and both carriage return and
 newline cause the current line to be completed and a new line begun.
 Furthermore, square brackets are translated to the corresponding
 curly braces (unless the SETBRACK function was used to change this).

 The default tabs mode is ON for terminal files and OFF for other files.

 PRIN1-style print operations are not sensitive to TABS mode; all
 characters are output as is to preserve read-print equivalency.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid output file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified output file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 See member SETBRACK to see how to control the printing of square
 brackets when TABS mode is active for a file.

Examples:

 (TABS NIL) and (TABS NIL NIL) are equivalent, and set tabs mode off
        for the standard output file.

 (TABS T 'FOO)      sets tabs mode on for output file FOO.
