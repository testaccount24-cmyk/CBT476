Function: GENSYM

Syntax:   (GENSYM &optional arg1)

Returns:

 A unique uninterned symbol (not on the oblist) whose print name
 consists of the "GENSYM prefix" concatenated with a number
 incremented sequentially by each invocation.

Processing:

 The GENSYM counter (initially 1) is used to construct a symbol name,
 and a symbol is built from it and the GENSYM prefix (initially "G").
 The symbol is not interned, which means that it will not be EQ to any
 other atom.

 Following creation of the symbol, the GENSYM counter is incremented.

 If the optional argument is specified, it is processed as follows:

 If it is an integer, it must be non-negative; the GENSYM counter is
 set to that value and then used when the symbol is created; it
 becomes the basis for all counter incrementing until the counter
 is reset again.

 If it is a string, it becomes the new GENSYM prefix, and is used in
 the creation of this and all subsequent GENSYM's until the prefix
 is reset again.

 If it is a symbol, the symbol's print name is used as for strings
 as described above.

 If the optional argument is omitted, the current prefix and counter
 are used to create the symbol name.

Errors signaled:

 Not enough vector/string space to build the object.

Notes:

 The GENSYM number is converted to a decimal value of not less than
 6 digits, including leading zeroes.

 Resetting the counter will create atoms that appear to have the same
 print name as previously created GENSYM atoms; however, they will still
 be unique.  Use of such atoms in contexts where the generated names are
 required to be unique on a character basis, however, is not guaranteed.

 In the current implementation, the GENSYM counter may not be a bignum.
 In fact, it will overflow when the value exceeds 2147483647.  However,
 unique GENSYMs will still be created, even though their names may not
 be all that wonderful.

Examples:

 (GENSYM '7)    ==> G00007
 (GENSYM)       ==> G00008
 (EQ (GENSYM) (GENSYM)) ==> NIL ; Always NIL.
 (GENSYM '100)  ==> G00100
 (GENSYM "FOO") ==> FOO00101
 (GENSYM)       ==> FOO00102
 (GENSYM 4)     ==> FOO00004
 (GENSYM 'G)    ==> G00005
 (SETQ A (GENSYM))  ==> G00006
 (EQ A 'G00006)     ==> NIL
 (= A 'G00006)      ==> T
