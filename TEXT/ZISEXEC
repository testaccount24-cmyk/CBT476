Function: ZISEXEC

Syntax:   (ZISEXEC &rest args)

 arg (required, evaluated) - a string (or symbol).

Returns:

 An integer containing the return code from the ISPF dialog service
 specified by the command buffer built from concatenating the text
 of the arguments.

Processing:

 The arguments are concatenated to form a character string buffer which
 is assumed to contain a valid ISPF dialog service request in ISPEXEC
 format, and it is executed.

 The dialog service request buffer is translated to upper case, UNLESS
 the request is a SELECT service.  If the first seven characters of the
 service request are "SELECT " (or "select "), the buffer is left asis
 with respect to case.

 If no arguments are specified, a null buffer is built and executed as
 a dialog service (at least at this time), which is of course an error.

 The system routine ISPEX (alias of ISPEXEC) is used to invoke the
 service.  Naturally, ISPF must be active (i.e. ZIL must have been
 invoked under ISPF, and not via the Draper XINVOKE command or the
 TSO/Extensions Authorized Service Facility).

 The return code from the ISPF dialog service is used to build a fixnum
 containing the value to be returned as the ZISEXEC function value. This
 will generally be a number between 0 and 20.  Note, however, that
 return codes over 8 will be returned only if ISPEXEC CONTROL ERRORS
 RETURN is active; otherwise the dialog error will terminate the
 entire ZIL environment without warning.

 You can invoke any ISPF dialog service that is supported by the
 ISPEXEC routine as documented in the Dialog Services manuals for
 either ISPF or ISPF/PDF.  The syntax is the same as for the ISPEXEC
 CLIST pseudocommand.  Do not include "ISPEXEC" itself in the buffer;
 the first word should be the dialog service name (DISPLAY, TBOPEN,
 VGET, etc.).

 To access the values of function pool variables, which many ISPF
 dialog services update,  you must use the ZISGET and ZISPUT functions.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid ISPF dialog service string (args cannot be converted to
 string format).

 ISPF dialog services not available; either ZIL is running outside
 of ISPF or it is running under the TSO Authorized Service Facility
 or other environment where ISPF dialog services are temporarily
 unavailable.

Notes:

 ISPF Version 2 must be installed to use this function.

 Unless CONTROL ERRORS RETURN is active, a dialog service that fails
 will terminate ZIL entirely.  The same will happen if a dialog error
 occurs within a SELECTed dialog under this facility, even if CONTROL
 ERRORS RETURN is active.

 After a dialog service fails (with a return code greater than 8),
 you may access the error by using the ZISGET function to retrieve the
 value of ZERRMSG, ZERRSM and/or ZERRLM.

Examples:

 (ZISEXEC "control errors return")

 (ZISEXEC "display panel(" some-panel ")")
