Function: SETABEND

Syntax:   (SETABEND arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.

Returns:

 arg1, after issuing an ESTAE macro instruction to control the
 operation of ZIL if an abnormal termination (ABEND) should occur.

Processing:

 If arg1 is NIL, then any ABENDs occurring in ZIL code will cause
 the entire ZIL session to be abnormally terminated.

 Otherwise, any ABENDs occurring in ZIL code will cause an error to
 be signalled and a THROW to tag NIL to occur, as for any normal
 kind of ZIL error.

Errors signaled:

 ESTAE failure (e.g. some other routine cancelled ZIL's ESTAE).

Notes:

 Certain ZIL floating-point operations may result in program checks
 (e.g. overflow).  If (SETABEND NIL) is specified, these will result in
 termination of ZIL.

 Some ZIL operations are uninterruptible (e.g. the garbage collector).
 If an ABEND occurs during such a process, the ZIL session is abnormally
 terminated, as no recovery is possible.

 Abends in programs or commands invoked from ZIL via the INVOKE or TSO
 functions never terminate ZIL; neither do abends on file opens.
 However, errors in I/O are subject to SETABEND control.

Examples:

 (SETABEND T) enables abend handling.
 (SETABEND NIL) disables abend handling.
