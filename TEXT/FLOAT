Function: FLOAT

Syntax:   (FLOAT arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a number.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - a flonum.

Returns:

 arg1 converted to a flonum.

Processing:

 If arg2 is omitted or NIL, the following takes place:

  If arg1 is a single-float or double-float, itself is returned.

  If arg1 is an integer, the value is converted to double-float
  and returned as a flonum.

 If arg2 is specified, the following takes place:

  If arg1 is a flonum of the same type (single or double) as arg2,
  itself is returned.

  Otherwise, arg1 is converted to a flonum of the same type as arg2
  (single-float or double-float) and that value is returned as a
  flonum.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument.

Notes:

Examples:

 (FLOAT 3)          ==> 3.0
 (FLOAT 3.5)        ==> 3.5
 (FLOAT 3.5F0)      ==> 3.5F0
 (FLOAT 3 0.0)      ==> 3.0
 (FLOAT 3 0.0F0)    ==> 3.0F0
 (FLOAT 3.0 0.0)    ==> 3.0
 (FLOAT 3.0 0.0F0)  ==> 3.0F0
 (FLOAT 3.0F0 0.0)  ==> 3.0
 (FLOAT 3.0F0 0.0F0)==> 3.0F0
