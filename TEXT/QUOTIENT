Function: QUOTIENT

Syntax:   (QUOTIENT &rest args)
    or:   (/ &rest args)

 arg (evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 The quotient (taken in succession) of all the arguments.

Processing:

 If no arguments are specified, 1 is returned.  If one argument is
 specified, then for QUOTIENT, that argument is returned; for /, the
 result of dividing 1 by that argument is returned.  Note that if the
 argument is an integer whose absolute value is greater than 1, the
 result will be zero, which makes it rather useless an operation.
