Function: EXPLODEC

Syntax:   (EXPLODEC arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 A list of single-character symbols corresponding to the
 character representation of arg1 as printed out via PRINC.

Processing:

 arg1 is converted to the character representation which it has when it
 is printed - as it looks via PRINC.  Each character in this
 representation is then used to build a symbol whose print name is that
 single character, and all of these symbols are interned on the oblist
 and consed together to form a list, which is returned as the value.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Compare EXPLODE, which is similar but uses the representation
 generated by PRIN1.

Examples:

 (EXPLODEC 'A)     ==> (A)
 (EXPLODEC NIL)    ==> (N I L)
 (EXPLODEC 007)    ==> (|7|) ; note that this is the symbol |7|,
                              ; not the fixnum 7.
 (EXPLODEC '|007|) ==> (|0| |0| |7|) ; note symbols all.
 (EXPLODEC "hi")   ==> (|h| |i|)

 (EXPLODE '|a b|)        ==> (|\|| |a| | | |b| |\||)
 (EXPLODEC '|a b|)       ==> (|a| | | |b|)
 (EXPLODE "abc")         ==> (|"| |a| |b| |c| |"|)
 (EXPLODEC "abc")        ==> (|a| |b| |c|)
