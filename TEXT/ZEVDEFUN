Function: ZEVDEFUN

Syntax:   (ZEVDEFUN arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a list.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - T or NIL.

Returns:

 The first element of arg1 (which DEFUN returns).

Processing:

 This function implements DEFUN at run time.  arg1 is the argument
 list passed to DEFUN, with the CAR being the function name.

 arg2 specifies whether DEFUN is being invoked at "top level" (T)
 or not (NIL).

 See DEFUN for more information.

Errors signaled:

 DEFUN syntax errors (invalid arg1).
 Not at top level (arg2 is NIL).

Notes:

 ZEVDEFUN always creates an INTERPRETED definition.

 There is a macro XDEFUN, which can be used to invoke DEFUN at run
 time (similarly to XDEFUN and XDEFMACRO).  The syntax is identical to
 that of DEFUN.  XDEFUN expands into a call to ZEVDEFUN.
