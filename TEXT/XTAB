Macro: XTAB

Syntax:   (XTAB arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 A fixnum containing the sum of arg1 plus 1, which is used to increment
 the current character pointer of the output file specified by arg2.

Processing:

 The ZGETFPO function is invoked to retrieve the current character
 pointer, and the ZPUTFPO function is invoked to update it.  The value
 specified in the XTAB function is a zero-based offset, which is
 transformed into a 1-based column specification by the macro expansion.

 See ZGETFPO and ZPUTFPO for more information.

Errors signaled:

 Errors detected by ZGETFPO, ZPUTFPO and ZILADD (q.v.).

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 Use of an out-of-range value as the first argument may cause
 serious errors in the ZIL environment.  Do so with extreme caution.

 The following examples illustrate the macro expansion for XTAB:

 (XTAB 3 FILE) --> (ZPUTFPO (ZILADD (ZGETFPO FILE) 3) FILE)
 (XTAB N FILE) --> (ZPUTFPO (ZILADD (ZGETFPO FILE) N) FILE)

Examples:

 (XTAB 1) and (XTAB 1 NIL) are equivalent, and cause the current
       column position of standard output to be "tabbed" over 1 space.

 (XTAB N 'BAR)  causes the current column position of output file BAR
                to be "tabbed" over N spaces.
