Function: ASIN

Syntax:   (ASIN num1)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the arcsine of num1 in radians.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the
 value from num1.  If num1 is a single-precision flonum, the
 result is a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is
 a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

 num1 not a number between -1 and 1.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

Examples:

(ASIN 0)     ==> 0.0
(ASIN 1)     ==> 1.57079632
(ASIN -1)    ==> -1.57079632
(ASIN 0.5)   ==> 0.52359877
(ASIN -0.5)  ==> -0.52359877
(ASIN 0.5F0) ==> 0.5235988F0
(ASIN "foo") ==> ("***ERROR***")
(ASIN 1000)  ==> ("***ERROR***")
