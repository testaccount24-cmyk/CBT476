Function: ZCADR

Syntax:   (ZCADR list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a cons (list or dotted pair).

Returns:

 The ZCAR of the CDR of list1.

Processing:

 This function is identical to CADR, except that it is an error if the
 CDR of the argument is NIL.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 This function may be used to generate very efficient compiled code when
 it is known that the the CDR of the argument will never be NIL.

Examples:

 (ZCADR '(A B C D E))  ==> B
