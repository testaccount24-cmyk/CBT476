Function: STRUCTURE

Syntax:   (STRUCTURE &rest args)

 At least 1 argument must be specified.

 arg (evaluated) - any LISP object; but the first must be a symbol.

Returns:

 A structure whose type is the first argument and whose elements are
 the remaining arguments.

Processing:

 A new structure is built, of dimension equal to the number of elements
 specified.  The type of the structure is set to the first element, and
 the elements of the structure are initialized to the remaining
 specified values.

 The predicates VECP and STRUCTP are true of structures.

Errors signaled:

 No arguments specified, or first argument is not a symbol.
 Not enough vector/string space to build structure.

Notes:

 STRUCTURE is generally not to be used by the ZIL programmer.  Use
 DEFSTRUCT to define and manipulate structures.
