Function: ZISPUT

Syntax:   (ZISPUT arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a string (or symbol).
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a symbol, string or number.

Returns:

 arg2, after setting the value of the ISPF dialog variable whose name
 is arg1 to the value arg2.

Processing:

 The ISPF VREPLACE service is invoked to update the value of the ISPF
 dialog variable whose name is specified by arg1.

 The value is always stored as a character string, regardless of the
 type of arg2.  Note that arg2 cannot be a list, vector or structure.

 Naturally, ISPF must be active (see ZISEXEC for more information).

 You will need to use this function to update the values of dialog
 variables that you wish to reference in services like VPUT and DISPLAY.

 To access the value of an ISPF dialog variable, use the ZISGET
 function.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid ISPF dialog variable name (not a string or symbol of from 1
 to 8 characters in length).

 Invalid arg2 (a list, vector or structure).

 ISPF dialog services not available; either ZIL is running outside
 of ISPF or it is running under the TSO Authorized Service Facility
 or other environment where ISPF dialog services are temporarily
 unavailable.

 ISPF dialog error (return code 20) returned from the VREPLACE service.

Notes:

 ISPF Version 2 must be installed to use this function.

 Unless CONTROL ERRORS RETURN is active, a VREPLACE service that fails
 will terminate ZIL entirely.

Examples:

 (ZISPUT 'foo "bar") sets the ISPF dialog variable FOO to "bar".

 (ZISPUT 'baz 1) sets the ISPF dialog variable BAZ to "1".
