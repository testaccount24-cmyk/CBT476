Function: RMCHAR

Syntax:   (RMCHAR)

Returns:

 A symbol whose print name is the current reader macro character.

Processing:

 When the READ function is about to process a reader macro, it sets
 the current macro character whose macro it is processing.  This
 value is returned by the RMCHAR function.

 If this function is executed outside of a reader macro processing
 environment, unpredictable results will occur.

 RMCHAR is meant to be executed by a reader macro which needs to
 reference the macro character which triggered it.  Therefore,
 the symbol is always interned on the oblist.

 RMCHAR does NOT return the dispatching character associated with
 a # (sharp sign) reader macro subfunction.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 See documentation on READ, DEFRDMAC and RDRMACRO for more information
 on reader macro processing.

 Reader macro definitions for the following characters are predefined:

 ' (single quote)
 ` (backquote)
 , (comma)
 # (sharp sign)

 See member $RMACRO in this documentation for details on these.

Examples:

 Assume a reader macro defined thus:

   (DEFRDMAC '|?| '(LAMBDA (X) (LIST (RMCHAR) (READ X))))

 Then, when the following is read in:

   ?FOO

 the following will be returned by READ:

   (? FOO)

 (Note that under the interpreter, this will be evaluated by EVAL
 before the user sees the result.)
