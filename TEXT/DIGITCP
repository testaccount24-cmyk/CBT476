Function: DIGIT-CHAR-P

Syntax:   (DIGIT-CHAR-P char1 &optional (radix2 10))
    or:   (DIGITCP char1 &optional (radix2 10))

 char1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 radix2 (optional, evaluated) - a fixnum between 2 and 36.

Returns:

 A fixnum representing the numeric "weight" of the EBCDIC character
 represented by the fixnum char1, if it is a "digit" in the radix
 specified by radix2, else NIL.

Processing:

 If char1 is a number whose EBCDIC value represents a "digit" in the
 radix specified by radix2, its "weight" is returned; this is a fixnum
 whose value is the "meaning" of the digit in that radix.  If char1 is
 not in the range 0-255 or represents a non-numeric character in the
 specified radix, NIL is returned.

 Only alphabetic characters (lower or upper case) and EBCDIC numerics
 can be DIGIT-CHAR-P.

Errors signaled:

 char1 not a fixnum.
 radix1 not a fixnum between 2 and 36.

Notes:

Examples:

 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/9)    ==> 9     ; Default radix is 10.
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/a)    ==> NIL   ; Default radix is 10.
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/A)    ==> NIL   ; Default radix is 10.
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/a 16) ==> 10
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/a 8)  ==> NIL
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/9 16) ==> 9
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/9 10) ==> 9
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/9 8)  ==> NIL
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P #/1)    ==> 1     ; True in all valid radices.
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P 1)      ==> NIL
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P -1)     ==> NIL
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P 999)    ==> NIL
 (DIGIT-CHAR-P "0")    ==> ("***ERROR***") ; Not a fixnum.
