Special Form: SETARG

Syntax:   (ARG arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an integer.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - ayn LISP object.

Returns:

 arg2, after the arg1'th argument of the currently active LEXPR has
 been replaced by arg2.

Processing:

 As above.

Errors signaled:

 SETARG issued outside LEXPR.
 arg1 out of range, or otherwise invalid.

Notes:

 No error checking is done in compiled code.  Results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

 See member $LEXPR for information about LEXPR's.

 (DEFUN FOO X
        (LIST (SETARG 1 'A)
              (SETARG 2 'B)
              (ARG T)))  ==> FOO

 (FOO 'X 'Y 'Z)        ==> (A B (A B Z))
