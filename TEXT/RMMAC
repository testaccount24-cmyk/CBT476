Function: RMMAC

Syntax:   (RMMAC)

Returns:

 NIL, after changing the syntax of the slash (/) and backslash (\).

Processing:

 The read table is modified to treat the forward slash character /
 the same as the backslash \ character, i.e. as a single escape.

 The backslash then becomes a "normal" character, with no escapism.

 The purpose of this hack is to enable Maclisp-style reader syntax.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 To restore default reader syntax, use the RMINIT function.  Note,
 however, that that currently results in the cancellation of any
 user-defined reader macros.

Examples:

 Before executing RMMAC:

   '/foo\bar  ==>   /FOObAR

   (RMMAC)    ==>   NIL

 After executing RMMAC:

   '/foo\bar  ==>   fOO\BAR
