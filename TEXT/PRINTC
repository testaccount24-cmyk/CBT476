Function: PRINTC

Syntax:   (PRINTC arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - an output file name.

Returns:

 arg1, after it has been printed on the file specified by arg2.

Processing:

 PRINTC is like PRINT, but prints out in PRINC-like form rather
 than PRIN1-like form.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid output file object (not a symbol 4 characters or less).
 Specified output file is not allocated or could not be opened.

Notes:

 See member $FILE for more information on file names.

 See member $PRINTER for more information on printing functions.

 PRINTC does whatever PRINC does with respect to the manner in which
 it prints objects.  See PRINC for more information.

Examples:

 (PRINTC "a")
 (PRINTC "a" NIL) are equivalent and return A after printing...

                  a

                  on the standard output file.

 Note that the interpreter will print "a" (the returned value)
 on the standard output file as well; this will print on the next
 line, causing the user to see:

 a
 "a"

 as the result.

 Thus the value will appear twice to the user.

 (PROGN
  (PRINTC 'A             'FOO)
  (PRINTC NIL            'FOO)
  (PRINTC (CONS 'B 'C)   'FOO)
  (PRINTC (LIST 'B 'C)   'FOO)
  (PRINTC '|Hi there.|   'FOO)
  (PRINTC "a string"     'FOO)
 )
                 returns "a string" after printing...

                 A
                 NIL
                 (B . C)
                 (B C)
                 Hi there.
                 a string

                 on output file FOO.
