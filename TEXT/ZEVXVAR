Function: ZEVXVAR

Syntax:   (ZEVXVAR arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol.

 arg4 (required, evaluated) - a documentation string.

Returns:

 arg1.

Processing:

 This function implements calls to DEFVAR in compiled MODULE's.

 It receives 4 arguments: (1) the variable symbol (arg 1 to DEFVAR)
                          (2) either a constant initial value, or
                              a function of no arguments which can
                              be called to establish an initial value
                          (3) a boolean which specifies whether the
                              second argument is a constant or a
                              "thunk" (function of no arguments).
                          (4) the documentation string.

 The syntax of DEFVAR is:

  (DEFVAR variable &optional value documentation)

  When (DEFVAR variable) is specified, with no value...

              If the variable already has a SPECIAL binding,
              no action is taken.

              Otherwise, the variable is proclaimed to be SPECIAL
              (whatever form that takes).

              If the variable is not already SPECIALly bound,
              its binding cell is filled in with a binding, consisting
              of a CONS of the symbol with its new value.

  When (DEFVAR variable value ...) is specified...

              If the variable already has a SPECIAL binding,
              no action is taken.

              Otherwise, the variable is proclaimed to be SPECIAL
              (whatever form that takes).

              If the variable is not already SPECIALly bound,
              its binding cell is filled in with a binding, consisting
              of a CONS of the symbol with its new value.

              If there is a documentation string, it is made the
              value of the variable's DOCUMENTATION property.

              (The documentation is not added if the variable is
              already present in the environment.)

 See DEFVAR for more information.

Errors signaled:

 DEFVAR syntax errors (invalid arg1).
 Not at top level (arg2 is NIL).

Notes:

 ZEVDVAR is used by DEFVAR under the interpreter.  Compiled calls
 to DEFVAR in MODULE's use ZEVXVAR.

 There is a macro XDEFVAR, which can be used to invoke DEFVAR at run
 time (similarly to XDEFUN and XDEFMACRO).  The syntax is identical to
 that of DEFVAR.  XDEFVAR expands into a call to ZEVXVAR.
