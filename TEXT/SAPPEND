Function: STRING-APPEND

Syntax:   (STRING-APPEND &rest args)
    or:   (SAPPEND &rest args)

 arg (required, evaluated) - a string.

Returns:

 A string made up of all the args concatenated to form a new string.

Processing:

 If no arguments are specified, a null string is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a string.

Notes:

 As for many functions that take strings as arguments, symbols are
 permitted; their print names are used in that case.

 Arguments other than symbols and strings are not permitted.  (This
 is unlike CONCAT, for example, that allows most atomic objects as
 arguments, but makes a symbol.)  Use TOSTRING to transform numbers,
 for example, into strings.

 Compare STRING-APPENDL, which applies STRING-APPEND to a list
 of arguments.

Examples:

 (STRING-APPEND)                   ==> ""
 (STRING-APPEND "A")               ==> "A"
 (STRING-APPEND "foo" "bar" "baz") ==> "foobarbaz"
