Function: CDR

Syntax:   (CDR list1)

 list1 (required, evaluated) - a list.

Returns:

 NIL, if list1 is NIL; or the portion of the list specified by list1
 that does not include the first element (CAR); or, if list1 is a dotted
 pair, the second element of the pair.

Processing:

 The "rest" of a list, i.e. a list of the second through last elements,
 is the value returned.  This is always a sublist of the original list
 (not a copy).  CDR of NIL or of a one-element list returns NIL.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (under the interpreter only).

Notes:

 No errors are detected in compiled code; results are unpredictable
 if an invalid argument is passed.

Examples:

 (CDR NIL)                ==> NIL
 (CDR '(A))               ==> NIL
 (CDR '(A B))             ==> (B)
 (CDR '(A B C D))         ==> (B C D)
 (CDR '((A1 A2) (B1 B2))) ==> ((B1 B2))
 (CDR '(A . B))           ==> B
