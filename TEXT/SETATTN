Function: SETATTN

Syntax:   (SETATTN arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.

Returns:

 arg1, after issuing a STAX macro instruction to control the
 operation of ZIL if an attention interrupt (PA1) should occur.

Processing:

 If arg1 is NIL, then any attention interrupts entered by the user
 during ZIL code will cause the entire ZIL session to be flushed.

 Otherwise, any attentions occurring in ZIL code will cause the ZIL
 attention handler to gain control.  The handler permits the user to
 abort the current process (which causes a THROW to tag T, which is
 presumed to be "top level" from the point of view of the user)
 or to continue with the current process as if attention had never been
 hit.   If an attention interrupt is entered at this point, ZIL is
 flushed.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Some ZIL operations are uninterruptible (e.g. the garbage collector).
 If an attention interrupt occurs during such a process, the user's
 only options are to resume ZIL operation or flush ZIL entirely by
 hitting attention again.

 Attentions in programs or commands invoked from ZIL via the TSO
 function never terminate ZIL.

Examples:

 (SETATTN T) enables attention handling.
 (SETATTN NIL) disables attention handling.
