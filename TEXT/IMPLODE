Function: IMPLODE

Syntax:   (IMPLODE arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list of atoms.

Returns:

 An interned symbol whose print name consists of the characters in the
 list specified by arg2, concatenated to form a new atom name.

Processing:

 The CAR's of arg1, which must be a non-null list of fixnums, strings
 and/or symbols, are converted as follows:

  For a fixnum, its EBCDIC character equivalent is obtained.
  For a string, its first character is obtained.
  For a symbol, the first character of its print name is obtained.

 These are concatenated to build an interned symbol whose print name is
 the string resulting from the concatenation.

 arg1 may be NIL, in which case a symbol with a null print name is
 returned.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a list of atoms (nested lists and vectors are not permitted).
 An object other than a fixnum, string or symbol was encountered.

Notes:

 Compare MAKNAM, which is identical but doesn't intern its symbol.

 The old ZIL 1.1 IMPLODE is now called ZILIMPL; the IMPLODE described
 here is essentially the Maclisp definition.

Examples:

 (IMPLODE NIL)                 ==> ||
 (IMPLODE '(A))                ==> A
 (IMPLODE '(F O O))            ==> FOO
 (IMPLODE '(FOO BAR))          ==> FB
 (IMPLODE '(#/a #/b "c"))      ==> |abc|

 (SETQ A (IMPLODE '(F O O)))   ==> FOO
 (EQ A 'FOO)                   ==> T
