Function: RUNTIME

Syntax:   (RUNTIME)
    or:   (CPUTIME)

Returns:

 An integer containing the number of milliseconds (thousandths of a
 second) of CPU time used so far in the current TSO session or batch
 job.

Processing:

 The value is taken from the "job step elapsed time" field of the
 address space control block (ASCB) and converted to milliseconds.
 This is the same source of the info that the TSO CLIST variable
 &SYSCPU uses.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 For compatibility with earlier ZIL code, this function may also be
 called CPUTIME.

 This is generally useful only by taking the value at two different
 points and subtracting to get CPU time elapsed between those points.
