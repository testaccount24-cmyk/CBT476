Processing:

 XDEFMACRO causes a run-time INTERPRETIVE macro definition to occur
 (suitable for compiled initialization routines).

 Under the interpreter, XDEFMACRO is identical to DEFMACRO, except that
 it may be used in places where DEFMACRO is not allowed (i.e. at other
 than "top level").

 See DEFMACRO for more information.

 See DEFMACRO.

Notes:

 XDEFUN bears the same relationship to DEFUN, and may be used to
 compile run-time INTERPRETIVE function definitions.
