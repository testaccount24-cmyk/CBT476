Function: MAKE-LIST

Syntax:   (MAKE-LIST arg1 &optional arg2)
    or:   (MKLIST arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 A list of (n) elements, where n is the value of arg1, and all of
 the elements are arg2.

Processing:

 A list is CONSed up with the number of elements specified by arg1,     urned
 which must be a fixnum.  All of the elements are initialized to arg2,
 which defaults to NIL.

 A zero length is valid, in which case the list has no elements.

Errors signaled:

 Length argument not a fixnum, or negative.

Notes:

 MAKE-LIST and MKLIST are equivalent and both acceptable names.

Examples:

 (MAKE-LIST 0)       ==> NIL
 (MAKE-LIST 1)       ==> (NIL)
 (MAKE-LIST 5)       ==> (NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)
 (MAKE-LIST 5 "foo") ==> ("foo" "foo" "foo" "foo" "foo")
