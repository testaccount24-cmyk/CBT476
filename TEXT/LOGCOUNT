Function: LOGCOUNT

Syntax:   (LOGCOUNT arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an integer.

Returns:

 If arg1 is non-negative, an integer containing the number of 1-bits in
 arg1.  If arg1 is negative, an integer containing the number of 0-bits
 in the two's-complement representation of arg1.

Processing:

 This is an integer-only operation.
 The number of 1-bits in the binary representation of arg1 is counted
 and returned as an integer.

 If arg2 is negative, the number of 0-bits is counted, rather than the
 number of 1-bits.  A two's-complement representation of arg2 is used to
 determine the bit count, assuming that the number contains 1-bits
 infinitely out to the left end.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not an integer.
