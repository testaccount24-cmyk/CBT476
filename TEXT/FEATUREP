Function: FEATUREP

Syntax:   (FEATUREP arg1)

 arg1  (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally a symbol.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is a member of the "features list", else NIL.

Processing:

 The list of features (which is the value of the global variable
 *FEATURES*) is searched for a value which is EQ to arg1.  If one
 is found, T is returned; else NIL is returned.

 An object which is FEATUREP may be used in the reader macro
 notations #+object and #-object.  #+object causes the next item
 to be read only if object is FEATUREP; #-object causes the next item
 to be read only if object is NOT FEATUREP.

 An object may be made to be FEATUREP by SET-FEATURE, and may be
 made NOT FEATUREP by SET-NOFEATURE.

 The "features" feature is generally used to select implementation-
 -dependent code at read time when processing LISP source code that is
 designed to run on more than one system.  See member $RMACRO of this
 documentation for more information on the use of "features".

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The following features are currently present in ZIL:

 ZIL ZIL13 GC BIGNUM MULTIPLE-VALUES DESTRUCTURING FLAVORS LOOP

 ... and, depending on the installation, some or all of:

 CSDL DRAPER TSO MVS XA VF

 In addition, under the interpreter, there is a ZILIN feature;
 under the compiler, there is a ZILCO feature;
 under OPS5, there is an OPS5 feature;
 under MACSYMA, there is a MACSYMA feature.

Examples:

 (FEATUREP 'ZIL)          ==> T
 (FEATUREP 'MACLISP)      ==> NIL

 (FEATUREP 'FOO)          ==> NIL
 (PROGN
  (SET-FEATURE 'FOO)
  (FEATUREP 'FOO)
 )                         ==> T

 (PROGN
  (SET-NOFEATURE 'FOO)
  (FEATUREP 'FOO)
 )                         ==> NIL
