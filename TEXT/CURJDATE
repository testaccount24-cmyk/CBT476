Function: CURJDATE

Syntax:   (CURJDATE)
    or:   (CURRENT-JDATE)

Returns:

 A list of 2 integers, representing the current Julian date as the
 year and days.

Processing:

 The current date is determined and a list is made of the 2 components.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 If a garbage collection occurs while building the list, the date
 returned may be inaccurate if it was requested before midnight
 but the GC completed after midnight.

 The year returned is a 4-digit year, as opposed to Zil prior to
 2000, which was not Y2K compliant and returned a 2-digit year.

Examples:

; (CURJDATE)    ==> (86 233)   ; on August 21, 1986
; (CURJDATE)    ==> (2000 104) ; on April 13, 2000
