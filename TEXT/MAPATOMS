Function: MAPATOMS

Syntax:   (MAPATOMS fun1)

 fun1 (required, evaluated) - a function that can be APPLY'd.

Returns:

 NIL, after applying fun1 to every interned symbol on the oblist.

Processing:

 This is a lot like (MAPC #'fun1 (OBLIST)) would be, except that
 returns NIL.

Errors signaled:

 Only those signalled by fun1 or FUNCALL

Notes:

 Unfortunately, there is no function like MAPATOMS that corresponds
 to (MAPCAR #'fun1 (OBLIST)).  Maybe there should be one.

Examples:

 (let ((z 0))
      (mapatoms #'(lambda (x)
                          (case x
                                ((foo bar baz)
                                 (incf z))
                                (t nil))))
      z)  ==> 3
