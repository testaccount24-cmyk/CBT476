Function: STRING-UPCASE

Syntax:   (STRING-UPCASE string1)
    or:   (UPCASE string1)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.

Returns:

 A string identical to string1, except that all lower-case
 alphabetic characters are replaced with their upper-case equivalents.

Processing:

 The input argument is not altered.

 As with most string-handling functions, symbols are acceptable.
 However, the returned value is always a string.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid first argument (not a string).
 Insufficient vector/string space to build the result.

Notes:

 Compare STRING-DOWNCASE.

Examples:

 (STRING-UPCASE "")          ==> ""
 (STRING-UPCASE "a")         ==> "A"
 (STRING-UPCASE "A")         ==> "A"
 (STRING-UPCASE "foo")       ==> "FOO"
 (STRING-UPCASE NIL)         ==> "NIL"
 (STRING-UPCASE '|Foo Bar|)  ==> "FOO BAR"
