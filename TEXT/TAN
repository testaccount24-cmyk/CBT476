Function: TAN

Syntax:   (TAN num1)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number which is the tangent of num1, where num1 is expressed in
 radians.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the
 value from num1.  If num1 is a single-precision flonum, the
 result is a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is
 a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument.
 For single precision, abs(arg) greater than 823549.5625.
 For double precision, abs(arg) greater than 3537118876014220.125.
 These values are the maximum that the FORTRAN subroutine library
 will successfully process.

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

 Bignums are not supported as arguments to this function.

 Since the tangent of PI/2, in theory, cannot exist because it would
 require division by zero, computation of (TAN n) where n is supposed
 to be PI/2 does not produce a result that bcan reasonably be
 considered valid.

 Similarly, the tangent of PI is supposed to be zero, but (TAN n) where
 n is a close approximation of PI is unlikely to return this result.

Examples:

(TAN 0) ==> 0.0
(TAN 1) ==> 1.55740772
(TAN -1) ==> -1.55740772
(TAN 0.5) ==> 0.54630248
(TAN 0.5F0) ==> 0.5463025F0
