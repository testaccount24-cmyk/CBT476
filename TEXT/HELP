Notes:

 The HELP information is taken from the online dataset specified by
 the global variable *ZIL-HELP-LIBRARY*, whose default value is:
   "PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT" for the production system;
   "PROGLIB.ZIL.NTEXT" for the test system;
   "PROGLIB.ZIL.OTEXT" for the backup system.
 (Note that the string, although containing a fully qualified name,
  does not contain single quotes.)
 You can list, browse or print members of this
 dataset as well as viewing them via the HELP function.

Examples:

 (HELP ZIL)   displays the introduction to ZIL.

 (HELP CAR)   displays information on CAR in line mode.

 (HELP + T)   displays information on PLUS in full screen mode.
