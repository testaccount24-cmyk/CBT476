Function: ZEVINIT

Syntax:   (ZEVINIT)

Returns:

 NIL

Processing:

 ZEVINIT performs initialization of the ZIL environment.  It defines
 global variables, macro definitions, and some function definitions.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 ZEVINIT is automatically executed by every ZIL program at
 initialization time.  It is NOT supposed to be invoked by ZIL code
 directly.  Invoking ZILINIT will reset lots of things to their default
 values, some in strange ways.
