Function: HAIPART

Syntax:   (HAIPART arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an integer.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.

Returns:

 If arg2 is non-negative, an integer whose contents are the high-order
 arg2 bits of (ABS arg1).  If arg2 is negative, a fixnum whose contents
 are the (ABS arg2) low-order bits of (ABS arg1).

Processing:

 If (ABS arg2) is greater than the number of significant bits in arg1
 (i.e. (HAULONG arg1)), (ABS arg1) is returned.

Errors signaled:

 First argument not an integer.
 Second argument not a fixnum.

Notes:

Examples:

 (HAIPART  7 2)       ==> 3
 (HAIPART  #o1234 3)  ==> 5
 (HAIPART -153 4)     ==> 9
 (HAIPART  123 -4)    ==> 11
 (HAIPART -123 -4)    ==> 11
