Function: VECP

Syntax:   (VECP arg1)

 arg1 (required,evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is a vector-type object, otherwise NIL.

Processing:

 A "vector-type object" is an object which is composed of contiguous
 instances of other LISP objects; i.e. an object on which it is
 valid to do operations like VREF and VSET.

 In ZIL, vectors, structures, and funargs (interpreted lexical
 closures) are all VECP.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:
Examples:

 (VECP '(A B C))              ==> NIL
 (VECP #(A B C))              ==> T
 (VECP (STRUCTURE 'A 'B 'C))  ==> T
 (VECP #'FOO)                 ==> T ; if interpreted; NIL if compiled
