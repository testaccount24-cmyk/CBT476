Function: MKNUMBER

Syntax:   (MKNUMBER string1)
    or:   (MAKE-NUMBER string1)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.

Returns:

 If string1 is syntactically numeric, a numeric atom which, when
 printed, looks like string1; otherwise an uninterned symbol whose print
 name consists of string1.

Processing:

 An attempt is made to build a numeric atom (fixnum, flonum or bignum),
 according to the syntax of string1 as the READ function would interpret
 it.  If the string is not syntactically numeric, then an uninterned
 symbol is created whose print name is string1.

 Notes:

 (1) List notation (parentheses, dots, etc.) is not valid and will
     be treated as part of a symbol name.

 (2) Floating-point overflow is not detected by the code, and may
     result in a program check (0CC) abend.  Floating-point underflow is
     ignored and may produce a zero result.

Errors signaled:

 string1 not a string or symbol.                                        ).

Notes:

Examples:

 (MAKE-NUMBER "007")           ==> 7     ; a fixnum.
 (MAKE-NUMBER "1.5")           ==> 1.5   ; a flonum.
 (MAKE-NUMBER "A")             ==> A
 (MAKE-NUMBER "hi there")      ==> |hi there|
 (MAKE-NUMBER "(F O O)")       ==> |(F O O)| ; Lists are never built.

 (SETQ A (MKNUMBER "FOO"))     ==> FOO ; not interned.
 (EQ A 'FOO)                   ==> NIL
