Function: EXP

Syntax:   (EXP num1)

 num1 (required, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 A number whose value is E raised to the num1'th power.

Processing:

 The FORTRAN subroutine library interface is used to compute the
 value from num1.  If num1 is a single-precision flonum, the
 result is a single-precision flonum; otherwise the result is
 a double-precision flonum.

Errors signaled:

Notes:

 This function requires the FORTRAN subroutine library interface
 to be available.  See member $FORTRAN of this documentation for
 further information.

 This function will fail for values of num1 about 174.673 or greater.


Examples:

(EXP 1) ==> 2.71828182
(EXP 0) ==> 1.0
(EXP -1) ==> 0.36787944
(EXP 2.0) ==> 7.38905609
(EXP 2.0F0) ==> 7.3890562F0
