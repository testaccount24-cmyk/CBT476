Function: INTRQ

Syntax:   (INTRQ arg1 arg2)
    or:   (INTRQ arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 A list containing only the elements that occur in both arguments.

Processing:

 A new list is constructed from the elements of the two arguments;
 if an element occurs once in each list argument, it will occur
 once in the result.  No other guarantee is given with respect
 to the order of the elements, or how many times a given element
 will occur if it occurs more than once in one of the input lists.

 The test used is EQ.  Compare INTERSECTION, which uses the EQL test.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 No checking is done as to the validity of the arguments.
 Unpredictable results will occur if the first and second arguments
 are not proper lists.

Examples:

 (INTRQ NIL '(A B C))                   ==> NIL
 (INTRQ '(A B C) '(D E F))              ==> NIL
 (INTRQ '(A B C D E) '(A E I O U))      ==> (A E)
 (INTRQ '(1.0 2.0 3.0) '(2.0 3.0 4.0))  ==> NIL   ; Test is EQ.
