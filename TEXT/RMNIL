Function: RMNIL

Syntax:   (RMNIL)

Returns:

 An object, known as "RMNIL", which has special meaning to the reader.

Processing:

 When the READ function invokes a reader macro, it generally uses
 the value returned by the macro as the value "read".  However, in some
 cases a reader macro may wish to indicate that nothing was returned.
 The RMNIL function is used to transmit this wish back to the reader.
 When the reader receives this special object as a return value from
 a reader macro, it is redriven to read another object.  Thus the
 reader macro has returned "nothing" to the reader.

 If this function is executed outside of a reader macro processing
 environment, or an attempt is made to print its value, the results
 are undefined.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The same functionality may be provided by a reader macro by
 returning zero values (e.g. via the form (VALUES)).  RMNIL
 is present for compatibility with earlier releases of ZIL
 that did not contain multiple values processing.

 See documentation on READ, DEFRDMAC and RDRMACRO for more information
 on reader macro processing.

 The #+ and #- reader macro syntaxes use this function.

Examples:

 Assume a reader macro defined thus:

   (DEFRDMAC '|?| '(LAMBDA (X) (READ X) (RMNIL)))

 Then, when the following is read in:

   '(?FOO BAR BAZ)

 the "FOO" will be ignored and the result will be:

   (QUOTE (BAR BAZ))
