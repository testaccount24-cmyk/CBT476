Function: CONS

Syntax:   (CONS arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 A cons (list or dotted pair) whose CAR is arg1 and whose CDR is arg2.

 If arg2 is a list or NIL, a list is produced; if arg2 is an atom, a
 dotted pair is produced.  In fact, a list is the special case of a
 dotted pair whose second element is a list or NIL.

Processing:

 A new cell is obtained from available CONS space to construct the new
 object.  If CONS space is exhausted, a garbage collection occurs, and
 the new cell is returned if enough storage is reclaimed to permit it.

Errors signaled:

 No cons cells free after garbage collection.

Notes:

Examples:

 (CONS 'A '(B C D))       ==> (A B C D)
 (CONS 'A 'B)             ==> (A . B)
 (CONS 'A '(B))           ==> (A B)
 (CONS '(A B) '(C D))     ==> ((A B) C D)
 (CONS 'A NIL)            ==> (A)
 (CONS NIL NIL)           ==> (NIL)
