Function: ZILREM

Syntax:   (ZILREM num1 num2)

 num1 (required,evaluated) - an integer.
 num2 (required,evaluated) - an integer.

Returns:

 The remainder of the two arguments (num1 // num2).

Processing:

 This is the low-level 2-argument function that underlies REMAINDER.

 See "IBM/370 Principles of Operation" for a description of the
 remainder returned from an integer DIVIDE operation, which is
 essentially what this function returns.

 When both arguments are positive, the result is equivalent to the
 mathematical MOD function.

Errors signaled:

 Non-integer first or second argument.
 Second argument is zero.

Examples:

 (ZILREM 6 2)      ==> 0
 (ZILREM 9 2)      ==> 1
 (ZILREM -10 3)    ==> -1
 (ZILREM 10 -3)    ==> 1
 (ZILREM -10 -3)   ==> -1
