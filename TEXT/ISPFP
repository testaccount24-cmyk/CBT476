Function: ISPFP

Syntax:   (ISPFP)

Returns:

 T if ISPF dialog services are available in the current environment,
 else NIL.

Processing:

 A test similar to the one performed by ISPLINK is done to see if there
 is a valid ISPF environment, suitable for invoking dialog services.
 If there is, T is returned; otherwise NIL is returned.

 Note that this function is more accurate than, for example, the
 &SYSISPF CLIST variable, because ISPFP will return NIL in certain
 cases where &SYSISPF would give you the wrong answer, most notably
 when ZIL has been invoked via the TSO Authorized Service Facility
 under ISPF.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 ISPF Version 2 must be installed to use this function.

 It has been noted that ISPFP will falsely return T when ISPF dialog
 services are not available because of a subtasking environment that
 does not have a SELECT CMD at the top of the task tree.  However,
 this failure is present in the ISPF Version 2 Release 3 ISPQRY
 program as well, and may or may not be fixed by IBM.
