Function: REMDUPQL

Syntax:   (REMDUPQL arg1)

 arg1   (required, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 A list consisting of all the elements of arg1, but with duplicate
 elements removed.

Processing:

 A new list is built (through repeated CONS'ing) from the elements
 of the list specified by arg1.  If any element of the list is EQL
 to an element already in the list, it is not included; thus any such
 elements occur only once in the returned list.

 Note that only top-level elements of the list are considered;
 non-atomic elements are NOT recursively processed by REMDUPQL.

 Compare REMDUPQ, which is like REMDUPQL but uses an EQ test.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 No checking is done as to the validity of the arguments.  Unpredictable
 results will occur if arg1 is not a proper list.

Examples:

 (REMDUPQL '(F O O B A R B A Z F R O B)) ==> (F O B A R Z)

 (REMDUPQL '(2.0 1.0 4.0 7.0 4.0 8.0))   ==> (2.0 1.0 4.0 7.0 8.0)

 (REMDUPQL '((F O O) (F O O) (B A R)))   ==> ((F O O) (F O O) (B A R))
                                            ; Test is EQL, not EQUAL.
