Function: ROUND

Syntax:   (ROUND arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a number.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 Two values:

  (1) arg1, or arg1 divided by arg2, rounded to the nearest integer.
  (2) If arg1 only is specified, the difference of arg1 and the
      first value.
      If arg1 and arg2 are specified, the remainder, i.e. the difference
      of arg1 and (arg2 times the first value).

Processing:

 If arg2 is specified, arg1 is divided by arg2 such that a floating
 point result is obtained.  Otherwise, the argument is set to arg1.

 If the argument is float, it is rounded to the nearest integer.
 The rounding is accomplished as if 0.5 were added to the absolute
 value of the result, with the exception that if the value of the
 argument lies exactly halfway between two integers (xxx.5), it
 is rounded to the next EVEN integer.

 If the argument is integer, itself is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Non-numeric argument(s).

Notes:

 Compare CEILING, FLOOR and TRUNCATE.

 The rounding to the nearest even integer algorithm breaks down in
 cases where a bignum result must be returned due to the magnitude
 of the floating-point argument.
