Function: ZEVDEFLD

Syntax:   (ZEVDEFLD arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a list of 2 symbols.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - T or NIL.

Returns:

 The second element of arg1 (which DEFLOAD returns).

Processing:

 This function implements DEFLOAD at run time.  arg1 is the argument
 list passed to DEFLOAD, which must be a list of 2 symbols.

 arg2 specifies whether DEFLOAD is being invoked at "top level" (T)
 or not (NIL).

 See DEFLOAD for more information.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid number or type of arguments (invalid arg1).
 Not at top level (arg2 is NIL).

Notes:

 There is a macro XDEFLOAD, which can be used to invoke DEFLOAD at run
 time (similarly to XDEFUN and XDEFMACRO).  The syntax is identical to
 that of DEFLOAD.  XDEFLOAD expands into a call to ZEVDEFLD.
