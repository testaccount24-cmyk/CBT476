Function: ZMVECTOR

Syntax:   (ZMVECTOR arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a list.

Returns:

 A vector of (n) elements, where n is the length of arg1, and all of
 the elements are taken from the CAR's of arg1.

Processing:

 A vector is allocated with the number of elements specified by the     urned
 length of arg1, and all of the elements are initialized to the
 elements of arg1.  In other words, the list arg2 is converted to
 a vector.

 A null list is valid, in which case the vector has no elements.

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not a proper list.
 Not enough vector space to build the vector, even after GC.

Notes:

 The #( syntax uses this function.

Examples:

 (ZMVECTOR ())        ==> #()
 (ZMVECTOR '(1))      ==> #(1)
 (ZMVECTOR '(A B C))  ==> #(A B C)
