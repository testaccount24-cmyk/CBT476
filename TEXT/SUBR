Special Form: SUBR

Syntax:   (SUBR arg1)

 arg1 (required, not evaluated) - a symbol or LAMBDA-expression.

Returns:

 Under the compiler:

 A compiled-code SUBR object, built from arg1 (the SUBR).  SUBRP is
 true of this object.

 Under the interpreter:

 arg1.

Processing:

 Under the compiler, SUBR generates a compiled code object for the
 function or LAMBDA-expression specified; if a LAMBDA-expression is
 specified, it is caused to be compiled.  No lexical closure is
 generated.

 Under the interpreter, SUBR is identical to QUOTE.  Its intention is
 to return an object which is to be interpreted like a function with
 the same definition as that object.  No closure is generated.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid SUBR name (not a symbol or a valid LAMBDA or LABEL expr).
 SUBR name is a macro or a special form.

Notes:

 See ZILLOAD and ZILXSUB for more information about SUBRs.
 Compare FUNCTION, which defines a lexical closure.  SUBRs do not
 capture a lexical environment when evaluated, unlike closures.
