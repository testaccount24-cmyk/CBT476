Function: ZILSRD

Syntax:   (ZILSRD arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a compiled code SUBR object.

Returns:

 arg1, after assigning the compiled code SUBR specified by arg1 as the
 "current ZIL reader".

Processing:

 The SUBR specified by arg1 is made the "current ZIL reader" by
 having its address inserted in the field which is used by ZCREAD
 to access the current ZIL reader.

 See $READER for information about how to specify the function to
 be used as the "current ZIL reader", and how it is used.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument.

Notes:

 A SUBR compiled code object is a value that is returned only by the
 ZILLOAD function.  Closures, whether compiled or interpreted, are not
 permitted by ZILSRD; use SETREAD to define the "current ZIL reader"
 using an arbitrary form that can be funcalled.

Examples:

;   (ZILSRD (ZILLOAD 'MYREAD))
;
;   or (ZILSRD (SUBR MYREAD)) under the compiler,
;
; makes a fictional bunch of read functions active.
