The following messages elicit responses from the ZIL user.
Appropriate responses are documented along with the message.

ZIL0051 ATTENTION INTERRUPT: TYPE A(BORT), R(ESUME), T(IME), H(ELP).

An attention interrupt was detected as a result of pressing attention
(PA1).  Responses:

 <enter>    -  Processing resumes as if no attention had occurred.
 <PA1>      -  The ZIL process is terminated, and control returns to
               "the system".
 A + <enter> - The current function is aborted and control returns to
               the "top level".  The identity of the "top level" is
               dependent upon the environment; normally, under the
               interpreter, this is the top level of the READ-EVAL-PRINT
               loop.  This level is defined as the scope of a CATCH
               frame using tag T.
 R + <enter> - Processing resumes as if no attention had occurred.
 T + <enter> - Time used so far is displayed via the TSO TIME command,
               and the user is reprompted as above.
 H + <enter> - Information describing these options is displayed,
               and the user is reprompted as above.
 anything else - The user is reprompted as above.


ZIL0052 NON-INTERRUPTIBLE PROCESS.  ABORTS WILL BE DEFERRED UNTIL PROCESS IS COMPLETE.

An attention interrupt was detected as a result of pressing attention
(PA1); ZIL is currently in a section of code that cannot be safely
interrupted (e.g. the garbage collector or the loader).  Responses are
the same as above.  However, if an abort is requested, the abort is
deferred until the uninterruptible section of code is completed.  The
deferral may not be perceptible, since in most cases the uninterruptible
window is short, but it is there.

ZIL0054 ATTENTION ABORT TO TOP LEVEL.

After an A was typed in response to message ZIL0051, a THROW to tag T
was executed, causing execution to resume at whatever was defined as the
LISP "top level", normally the READ-EVAL-PRINT loop.
