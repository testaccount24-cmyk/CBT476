Macro: COMMENT

Syntax:   (COMMENT &rest args)

 arg (optional, not evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 The symbol COMMENT.

Processing:

 This is treated as a comment, and does nothing.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Using real comments (with ; or #| ... |#) is preferable, since
 LISP syntax rules have to be adhered to inside (COMMENT ...)
 but not with the other constructs.

 The compiler will usually optimize out uses of COMMENT, but not
 if you use it somewhere where it has to return a value!

Examples:

 (COMMENT THIS IS JUST A DUMB COMMENT)  ==>  COMMENT
