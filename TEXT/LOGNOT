Function: LOGNOT

Syntax:   (LOGNOT arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an integer

Returns:

 An integer containing the result of a complement operation performed on
 arg1 - i.e. changing 0-bits to 1-bits and vice versa.

Processing:

 This is an integer-only operation.  If arg1 is negative, the
 operation is performed on the two's-complement representation.
 (LOGNOT a) is equivalent to (LOGXOR a -1).

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not an integer.

Notes:

Examples:

 (LOGNOT 0) ==> -1
 (LOGNOT -1) ==> 0
 (LOGNOT #zf00ff00f) ==> #z0ff00ff0
 (LOGNOT #xf00f00f00f00f00f00f00)  ==> #x-f00f00f00f00f00f00f01
