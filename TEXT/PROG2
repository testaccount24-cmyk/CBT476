Macron: PROG2

Syntax:   (PROG2 arg1 arg2 &rest args)

 argn (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 At least 2 arguments are required.

Returns:

 The second of the arguments, after evaluating all of them in sequence.

Processing:

 All of the arguments are evaluated; since only the value of the second
 is used, the others are generally specified for their effect only.
 The result of evaluating the second argument is returned as the value.

Errors signaled:

 Too few arguments (at least two are required).

Notes:

 PROG2 always returns a single value, no matter what the second form
 is.  See MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1, which returns all the values from
 the first form.

Examples:

 (PROG2 'A 'B)                    ==> B
 (PROG2 'A 'B 'C 'D)              ==> B
 (PROG2 (SETQ X '(A B))
        (CAR X)
        (SETQ X '(C D)))          ==> A
 (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST (PROG2 'A (VALUES 1 2 3) 'B))   ==> (1)
