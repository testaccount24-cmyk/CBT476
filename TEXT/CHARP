Function: CHARACTERP

Syntax:   (CHARACTERP arg1)
    or:   (CHARP arg1)

 arg1 (required,evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 T if arg1 is a "character" (i.e. an integer between 0 and 255),
 else NIL.

Processing:

 If the argument is a fixnum, and its value is such that it can be
 considered a "character" (i.e. it can fit in 8 bits), then T is
 returned.  Otherwise NIL is returned.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Characters are not a true data type in ZIL.  They are in Common LISP.

Examples:

 (CHARACTERP 1.0)          ==> NIL
 (CHARACTERP 1.0F0)        ==> NIL
 (CHARACTERP "1")          ==> NIL
 (CHARACTERP '(1))         ==> NIL
 (CHARACTERP 'ONE)         ==> NIL
 (CHARACTERP 1)            ==> T
 (characterp 0)            ==> T
 (characterp 255)          ==> T
 (characterp 256)          ==> NIL
 (characterp -1)           ==> NIL
 (characterp -255)         ==> NIL
 (characterp 0.0)          ==> NIL
 (characterp 2147483648)   ==> NIL
 (CHARACTERP 123456789876) ==> NIL
 (characterp #\space)      ==> T
 (characterp #\tab  )      ==> T
 (characterp #\nl   )      ==> T
 (characterp #\$    )      ==> T
 (characterp #\a    )      ==> T
 (characterp #\A    )      ==> T
 (characterp #\0    )      ==> T
 (characterp #\?    )      ==> T
 (loop for i from 0 to 255 always (characterp i))  ==> T
