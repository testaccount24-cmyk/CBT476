*        If you have the required ISPF setup for ZIL (CLIST, HELP,    *
*        PANEL, MSG, SKEL), all you need to do to use ZIL is invoke   *
*        the XZIL clist (from inside or outside of ISPF) to get to    *
*        the ZIL primary option menu.  From there you can invoke      *
*        the interpreter, call a compiled LISP program, or do a       *
*        foreground or background compile.                            *

The ISPF interface to ZIL is available by executing the clist XZIL,
either from READY mode (in which case other ISPF options are not readily
available), or from within ISPF option 6 (in which case you can split
the screen and use any other ISPF options you desire).

The first screen you will see is the ZIL primary option menu, which
should be self-explanatory.

The option you will use most often will be (3), the interpreter, which
is what users generally have in mind when "using LISP" is spoken of.
Options 4 and 5 may be used to compile LISP functions or programs;
options 7 and 9 are for the use of the ZIL developers only.
