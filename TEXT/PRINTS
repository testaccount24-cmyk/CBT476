Function: PRINTS

Syntax:   (PRINTS arg1 &optional opt2)

 arg1  (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 opt2  (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.

Returns:

 A string containing the printed representation of arg1.

Processing:

 A string is built which contains the characters which would appear
 if arg1 was printed (like PRINC if opt2 is omitted or NIL, else like
 PRIN1 if opt2 is specified and non-NIL).

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 The following macros are also available in ZIL.

  (PRINC-TO-STRING x)  is equivalent to (PRINTS x NIL).
  (PRIN1-TO-STRING x)  is equivalent to (PRINTS x T).

 See PRINC and PRIN1 for more information on how things are printed.


Examples:

 (PRINTS 'A)             ==> "A"
 (PRINTS '(FOO BAR))     ==> "(FOO BAR)"
 (PRINTS 007)            ==> "7"
 (PRINTS '|foo|)         ==> "foo"
 (PRINTS '|foo| NIL)     ==> "foo"
 (PRINTS '|foo| T)       ==> "|foo|"
