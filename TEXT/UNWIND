Special Form: UNWIND-PROTECT

Syntax:   (UNWIND-PROTECT protected-form &rest cleanup-forms)

 protected-form (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 cleanup-forms (evaluated) - any LISP object.

 At least 1 cleanup-form is required.

Returns:

 The result of evaluating protected-form, unless a THROW (or error)
 occurs during its evaluation, in which case the value returned by
 the THROW (NIL if an error) is returned.

Processing:

 protected-form is evaluated first.  An UNWIND-PROTECT frame is created
 and protected-form is evaluated; the frame is then deactivated
 (though it remains on the stack) and the cleanup-forms are evaluated.
 If during the evaluation of the protected form a non-local exit of any
 kind occurs that causes the evaluation of the protected form to abort
 (this includes THROW, GO, RETURN, and errors), the cleanup forms are
 still executed, but the returning of the value, if any, takes place as
 if there otherwise had been no enclosing UNWIND-PROTECT.

 The UNWIND-PROTECT frame stacked by UNWIND-PROTECT is removed when the
 evaluation of the protected form is complete (or when a non-local exit
 occurs).  This frame is used to store the current state of the ZIL
 environment, including the current variable binding environment; thus,
 variable bindings are restored to the status they possessed upon entry
 to the UNWIND-PROTECTed code.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid syntax (too few arguments to UNWIND-PROTECT).

Notes:

 See CATCH and THROW for more information.

 UNWIND-PROTECT is used when a function must restore an environment
 or perform otherwise essential code that cannot be skipped even if
 an error should occur.  See a Common LISP or other manual for more
 information on the usefulness of UNWIND-PROTECT.

 GO or RETURN may be issued from within the protected form or the
 cleanup form to outside the UNWIND-PROTECT, if there is a PROG which
 will process it.

Examples:

 (UNWIND-PROTECT 'A 'B) ==> A ; Trivial case.

 (CATCH 'FOO
   (UNWIND-PROTECT (THROW 'FOO 'BAR) (PRINT "FROB"))) ==> BAR
  ; after FROB is printed.
