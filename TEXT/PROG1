Macro: PROG1

Syntax:   (PROG1 arg1 &rest args)

 argn (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object.
 At least 1 argument is required.

Returns:

 The first of the arguments, after evaluating all of them in sequence.

Processing:

 All of the arguments are evaluated; since only the value of the first
 is used, the others are generally specified for their effect only.
 The result of evaluating the first argument is returned as the value.

Errors signaled:

 Too few arguments (at least one is required).

Notes:

 PROG1 always returns a single value, no matter what the first form
 is.  See MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1, which returns all the values from
 the first form.

Examples:

 (PROG1 'A)                       ==> A
 (PROG1 'A 'B)                    ==> A
 (PROG1 'A 'B 'C 'D)              ==> A
