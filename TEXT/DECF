Macro: DECF

Syntax:   (DECF place1 &optional decrement2)

 place1 (required) - a form acceptable to SETF which evaluates to a
                     number.
 decrement2 (optional, evaluated) - a number.

Returns:

 place1, after it has been decremented by decrement2.

Processing:

 place1 is typically a variable, but in general is any form acceptable
 as the first argument to SETF.
 The variable or location specified by place1 is decremented by
 subtracting from it the value of decrement2, which defaults to 1 if not
 specified.

Errors signaled:

 None by the macro, but the decrement will fail if bad args are used.

Notes:

 Compare INCF, which increments.

 DECF is a macro that expands something like this:

  (DECF a b)  --> (SETF a (- a b))

Examples:

 (SETQ A 10)  ==> 10
 (DECF A)     ==> 9
 A            ==> 9
 (DECF A 3)   ==> 6
 A            ==> 6
 (DECF A -1)  ==> 7
 A            ==> 7
