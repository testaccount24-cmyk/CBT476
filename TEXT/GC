Function: GC

Syntax:   (GC)

Returns:

 The list (NIL), i.e. a CONS of NIL and NIL, after forcing a
 garbage collection to occur.

Processing:

 The free list pointer is altered so that it points to the end of
 the free list, and a dummy CONS is issued; when CONS detects the end
 of the free list, it causes a garbage collection.  The dummy CONS
 is returned as the value of the function.

Errors signaled:

 No CONS cells free after garbage collection.

Notes:

Examples:
