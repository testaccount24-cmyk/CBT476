Function: ZILAPPLY

Syntax:   (ZILAPPLY fun1 list2 &optional env3 name4)

 fun1  (required, evaluated) - an atom or proper list.
 list2 (required, evaluated) - an argument list.
 env3  (optional, evaluated) - an evaluation environment.
 name4 (optional, evaluated) - a function name for error messages.

Returns:

 The result of applying the function specified by fun1 to the argument
 list specified by list2.

Processing:

 See APPLY for what fun1 must be.

 The following are all equivalent to (ZILAPPLY F '(1 2 3)):

  (APPLY F '(1 2 3))
  (APPLY F 1 '(2 3))
  (APPLY F 1 2 '(3))
  (APPLY F 1 2 3 NIL)

Errors signaled:

 See APPLY.

Notes:

 ZILAPPLY is the internal ZIL function that underlies APPLY.  It has
 the capability of being passed an evaluation environment and a
 function name for error messages, which APPLY does not give you.
 On the other hand, it does not have the flexible syntax of APPLY
 with respect to specifying the argument list.
 Not for general use.
