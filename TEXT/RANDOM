Function: RANDOM

Syntax:   (RANDOM &optional arg1)

 arg1 (optional, evaluated) - a positive fixnum or flonum.

Returns:

 A random number greater than 0 and less than arg1.

Processing:

 If arg1 is specified, a number of the same type between 0 and arg1
 is returned.
 If arg1 is omitted, the internal random state is reset (i.e.
 the seed), and a random fixnum is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid argument (not a positive fixnum or flonum).

Notes:

Examples:

; (There are no examples because the value returned by RANDOM is
;  supposed to be unpredictable, by definition.  However, the same
;  series of numbers should be generated by the same sequence of
;  calls to RANDOM in two different ZIL sessions.)
