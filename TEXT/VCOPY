Function: VCOPY

Syntax:   (VCOPY arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a vector-type object.

Returns:

 A vector-type object of the same type, size and elements of arg1.

Processing:

 An exact copy is made of arg1.

Errors signaled:

 Argument not a vector-type object (does not satisfy VECP).

Notes:

 A "vector-type object" is an object composed of contiguous instances
 of other LISP objects.  In ZIL, vectors, structures and funargs
 (interpreted lexical closures) are vector-type objects that satisfy
 the predicate VECP.

Examples:

 (VCOPY #(FOO BAR BAZ))       ==> #(FOO BAR BAZ)
 (VCOPY #())                  ==> #()
 (VCOPY (STRUCTURE 'A 'B 'C)) ==> #.(STRUCTURE 'A 'B 'C)
