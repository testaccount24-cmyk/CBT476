Function: ACSIZE

Syntax:   (ACSIZE)

Returns:

 An integer containing the total number of BYTES (not cells) in
 the currently active portion of CONS space.

Notes:

 This value may be specified via the PARM field, or in a DECLARE,
 when a ZIL "program" is run.  See members $PARM and DECLARE of
 this documentation for more information.

 This value controls how much of the total CONS space (as specified by
 CSSIZE) is in use, until it is determined (by the garbage collector)
 that more space is needed, at which time the ACSIZE value is doubled,
 provided that it does not exceed the CSSIZE value.  Thus, the value
 returned by (ACSIZE) can change during execution.

 Do not confuse this function with CSSIZE, which returns the total
 number of bytes in all of allocated CONS space.
