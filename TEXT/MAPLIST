Function: MAPLIST

Syntax:   (MAPLIST arg1 arg2 ... argn)

 At least 2 arguments must be specified.

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a symbol or LAMBDA-expression.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - a proper list.
 argn (optional, evaluated) - a proper list.

Returns:

 The list of values generated by the application of the function
 specified by the first argument to the sublists of the lists specified
 by the other arguments.

Processing:

 The function specified by the first argument is applied to each of
 the sublists (CDR's) of the lists specified by the other arguments,
 starting with the lists themselves and ending with the last non-NIL
 sublist.  A list is built of these values as they are generated, and
 returned as the value of the MAPLIST call.

 Processing ends as soon as one of the lists is exhausted
 (i.e. becomes NIL).

 If any list argument is NIL, NIL is returned as the value.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid number of arguments (function and at least 1 list required).

Notes:

 See member $MAP of this documentation for more information on what
 may be coded on a mapping function.

Examples:

 (MAPLIST #'LENGTH '(A B C D E F G)) ==> (7 6 5 4 3 2 1)

 (MAPLIST #'(LAMBDA (X) (EQ (CAR X) 'FOO)) '(FOO BAR BAZ FOO FROB))
                         ==>  (T NIL NIL T NIL)

 (MAPLIST #'APPEND '(A B C) '(D E F)) ==>((A B C D E F) (B C E F) (C F))
