Function: MACROEXPAND-1

Syntax:   (MACROEXPAND-1 arg1)
    or:   (MEXPAND1 arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an atom or proper list.

Returns:

 A form which represents the expansion of the macro call specified by
 the first argument.

Processing:

 If arg1 is an atom, it is returned unchanged; otherwise it is assumed
 to be a proper list.  If the CAR of this list is a symbol with the
 MACRO property, then the list is a macro call, and the value of the
 MACRO property is used to expand the macro call.  Otherwise the list is
 returned unchanged.

 MACROEXPAND-1 expands the form only once.  Compare MACROEXPAND (aka
 MEXPAND), which expands the form repeatedly until the form is not a
 macro call.

 Also compare FEXPAND, which does a code-walking full macroexpansion
 of its argument.

 The value of the MACRO property is assumed to be a LAMBDA list valid
 for a macro definition.  If it is not, it is APPLY'ed with a warning
 message.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Unpredictable results will occur if the first argument is not an atom
 or a proper list.

Examples:

 (DEFMACRO M1 (X) `(M2 ,X))         ==> M1
 (DEFMACRO M2 (X) `(M3 ,X))         ==> M2

 (MACROEXPAND-1 '(M1 (M1 A)))           ==> (M2 (M1 A))
 (MACROEXPAND   '(M1 (M1 A)))           ==> (M3 (M1 A))
 (FEXPAND       '(M1 (M1 A)))           ==> (M3 (M3 A))
