Function: SETREAD

Syntax:   (SETREAD arg1)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a LISP object that can be invoked as a
                              function of 6 arguments.

Returns:

 A SUBR that implements the activation of the function specified by arg1
 as the "current ZIL reader".

Processing:

 The function specified by arg1 is made the "current ZIL reader" by
 having the address of a compiled SUBR wrapper inserted by ZILSRD in the
 field which is used by ZCREAD to access the current ZIL reader.  This
 causes the function arg1 to be invoked as the "current ZIL reader".

 See $READER for information about how to specify the function to
 be used as the "current ZIL reader", and how it is used.

Errors signaled:

 None (but beware of errors in your reader function!!!!!!!).

Notes:

 This is the general interface to setting the "current ZIL reader".
 Performance-conscious applications should use ZILSRD and create a
 compiled code SUBR to be the "current ZIL reader".

Examples:

;   (SETREAD #'(LAMBDA (A B C D E F) (MYREAD A B C D E F)))
;
; makes a fictional bunch of read functions active.
; However, ZILSRD is the recommended way to do this in this case.
