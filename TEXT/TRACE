Macro: TRACE

Syntax:   (TRACE &rest funs)

 fun (optional, not evaluated) - zero or more function names (symbols).

Returns:

 If no operands are specified, the list of functions currently being
 traced; otherwise, funs, after tracing has been activated for the
 functions named in the list.

Processing:

 If no funs are specified, the list of functions for which tracing is
 currently enabled is returned; no other action is taken.

 Otherwise, tracing is activated for each function name in this list
 which has a function definition (autoloading will be done of
 necessary to locate this function definition).  If a function is
 not currently defined, it will not be traced.

 Only EXPR's and SUBR's can be traced; FEXPR's and MACRO's cannot.
 Furthermore, calls from compiled code to compiled code cannot be
 traced unless the calls are implemented indirectly (via FUNCALL).

 The UNTRACE function is used to turn tracing off.

Errors signaled:

 One of the funs not a symbol.

Notes:

 See member $TRACE of this document for a description of tracing.

 See also AT, OFF and PUTDATA for more information.

 See ZILTRACE for technical details on how tracing and untracing
 are effected.

Examples:

 (TRACE)          returns the list of functions currently being traced.

 (TRACE FOO)          activates tracing for function FOO.

 (TRACE CAR CDR CONS) activates tracing for functions CAR, CDR and CONS.
