Function: ASSQ

Syntax:   (ASSQ arg1 alist2)

 arg1   (required, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally a symbol.
 alist2 (required, evaluated) - a list in association list format
                                (i.e. a list of dotted pairs).

Returns:

 The first dotted pair in alist2 whose CAR is EQ to arg1;
 NIL if no such pair exists.

Processing:

 alist2 (an association list) is searched for an element (dotted pair)
 whose CAR is EQ to arg1.  When the first such pair is found, the
 pointer to it is returned.  The caller of ASSQ may use the CDR of the
 returned pair as the "value" of arg1 as found on the alist2 association
 list, unless NIL is returned, indicating no value found.

 NIL may occur in place of a dotted pair anywhere within alist2; when
 this is the case, it is skipped over and the search continues.

Errors signaled:

 alist2 not a list.

Notes:

 Unpredictable results will occur if the second argument is not NIL or
 a list of dotted pairs.

 ASSQ is equivalent to Common LISP (ASSOC ... #TEST #'EQ).
 Compare ASSOC, which is like ASSQ but uses an EQL test by default.

Examples:

 (ASSQ 'A NIL)                            ==> NIL
 (ASSQ 'A '((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3)))     ==> (A . 1)
 (ASSQ 'D '((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3)))     ==> NIL
 (ASSQ 'BAZ '((FOO . BAR) (BAZ . FROB) (BAZ . NICATE)))
                                          ==> (BAZ . FROB)

 ;The following shows that the comparison test is EQ.

 (ASSQ 1.0 '((1.0 . A) (2.0 . B) (3.0 . C)))      ==> NIL
