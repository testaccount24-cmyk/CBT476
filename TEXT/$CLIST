*        the ZIL primary option menu.  From there you can invoke      *

The following CLIST's are available to all TSO users:

       LISP      - invokes the ZIL interpreter directly.
       LISPCOMP  - compiles a ZIL LISP source file.

The following CLIST's are available via PROGLIB:

       XZIL      - invokes the ZIL ISPF interface.

       XZIFILE   - allocates a ZIL input file.
       XZOFILE   - allocates a ZIL output file.
       XZIFREE   - frees a ZIL input file.
       XZOFREE   - frees a ZIL output file.


(The CLISTs that handle ZIL files are especially useful for users who
 don't remember the format of ZIL file names.  The special file name
 structure was necessitated by the need of ZIL in an non-XA system to
 determine how much storage to reserve for the operating system, since
 it allocated the rest as CONS space.  However, you do not need to use
 these to access files under ZIL, since the LOAD and OPEN functions can
 reference data sets directly.)


 To use ZIL, if you have the ZIL libraries allocated, just enter:

  XZIL

 This places you in an ISPF-based full-screen dialog.  Option 3 runs the
 ZIL LISP interpreter; the rest should be self-explanatory.  A tutorial
 is contained as well.

 If you just want to run the interpreter with a minimum of fuss,
 the LISP CLIST is for you.  This starts up the ZIL interpreter
 without using ISPF; it can even be used on a line-mode terminal.

 Once you are in the interpreter, the LISP function (HELP) is
 available to assist you. (HELP FUNCTIONS) will display a list of
 available LISP functions.

 On TSO, if help is required, you may enter:

  HELP LISP

 which should direct you to other sources of information as well.
