Function: WORD

Syntax:   (WORD arg1 &optional arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - a fixnum.
 arg2 (optional, evaluated) - any LISP object, but generally T or NIL.

Returns:

 A 4-character symbol whose print name is the EBCDIC contents of arg1.

Processing:

 The value of arg1 is interpreted as 4 EBCDIC bytes and
 used to build a print name for a symbol.

 If arg2 is present and not NIL, the symbol is interned on the
 oblist; otherwise it is not.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 Compare UNWORD, which performs the reverse operation.

Examples:


 (WORD #z40404040)        ==> |    |
 (WORD #zE9C9D340 T)      ==> |ZIL |
