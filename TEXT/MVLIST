Special Form: MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST

Syntax:   (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST form1)

 form1 (required, evaluated) - any LISP object.

Returns:

 A list of all the multiple values returned by form1, or a list of the
 one value returned by form1 if form1 did not return multiple values.

Processing:

 form1 is evaluated with
 the expectation that multiple values may be returned, and the values
 are made into a list which is returned as the value of this special
 form.  If form1 returns no values, NIL is returned.  If form1 returns
 a single value, a singleton list of that value is returned.

Errors signaled:

 Missing argument.
 Too many arguments.

Notes:

 See VALUES and VALUES-LIST for information on how multiple values
 are returned from a function.

 See Guy Steele's "Common LISP: The Language", pp. 133-139, for
 an explanation of multiple values in LISP.  Although the constant
 MULTIPLE-VALUES-LIMIT is not defined in ZIL, returning more than
 4095 multiple values is not supported.

 In many cases, use of multiple values in ZIL is more expensive than
 just consing up a list of the values and extracting the values from
 the list via destructuring.  In any case, out of all the forms that
 request multiple values, only MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND in compiled code
 is guaranteed not to cons in ZIL.

Examples:

 (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST 'A)              ==> (A)
 (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST (VALUES))        ==> NIL
 (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST (VALUES 1))      ==> (1)
 (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST (VALUES 1 2 3))  ==> (1 2 3)
