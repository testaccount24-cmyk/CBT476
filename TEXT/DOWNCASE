Function: STRING-DOWNCASE

Syntax:   (STRING-DOWNCASE string1)
    or:   (DOWNCASE string1)

 string1 (required, evaluated) - a string.

Returns:

 A string identical to string1, except that all upper-case
 alphabetic characters are replaced with their lower-case equivalents.

Processing:

 The input argument is not altered.

 As with most string-handling functions, symbols are acceptable.
 However, the returned value is always a string.

Errors signaled:

 Invalid first argument (not a string).
 Insufficient vector/string space to build the result.

Notes:

 Compare STRING-UPCASE.

Examples:

 (STRING-DOWNCASE "")        ==> ""
 (STRING-DOWNCASE "a")       ==> "a"
 (STRING-DOWNCASE "A")       ==> "a"
 (STRING-DOWNCASE "foo")     ==> "foo"
 (STRING-DOWNCASE "FOO")     ==> "foo"
 (STRING-DOWNCASE NIL)       ==> "nil"
 (STRING-DOWNCASE '|Foo Bar|) ==> "foo bar"
