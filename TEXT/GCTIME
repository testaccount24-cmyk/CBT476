Function: GCTIME

Syntax:   (GCTIME)

Returns:

 An integer containing the number of milliseconds (thousandths of a
 second) of CPU time used so far by garbage collections in the the
 current ZIL session.

Processing:

 The value is initially zero, and incremented by each garbage collection
 by taking the difference between the "job step elapsed time" at start
 of GC and "job step elapsed time" at end of GC.  The time values are
 similar to those retrieved by the RUNTIME function.

Errors signaled:

 None.

Notes:

 (GCTIME) is a cumulative value.  To time a particular GC, record the
 value of (GCTIME) before and after, and take the difference.
