Macro: XDEFUN

Syntax:   (XDEFUN arg1 {arg2} arg3 arg4 ... argn)

 (The syntax is identical to that of DEFUN.)

Returns:

 arg1, after establishing a function definition for that argument in the
 current environment.

Processing:

 XDEFUN causes a run-time INTERPRETIVE function definition to occur
 (suitable for compiled initialization routines).

 Under the interpreter, XDEFUN is identical to DEFUN, except that
 it may be used in places where DEFUN is not allowed (i.e. at other
 than "top level").

 See DEFUN for more information.

Errors signalled:

 See DEFUN.

Notes:

 XDEFMACRO bears the same relationship to DEFMACRO, and may be used to
 compile run-time macro definitions.

Examples:

 (XDEFUN FIRST (X) (CAR X))

 (XDEFUN FIRST FEXPR (X A) (CAR (EVAL (CAR X) A)))

 (XDEFUN FIRST MACRO (X) (LIST 'CAR (CADR X)))

all define (at run time) a function that returns the CAR of its arg.
