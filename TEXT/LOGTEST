Function: LOGTEST

Syntax:   (LOGTEST arg1 arg2)

 arg1 (required, evaluated) - an integer.
 arg2 (required, evaluated) - an integer.

Returns:

 T or NIL, depending on whether any of the 1-bits contained in arg1
 are also 1 in arg2.

Processing:

 This is an integer-only operation.
 (LOGTEST a b) is equivalent to (NOT (ZEROP (LOGAND a b))).

Errors signaled:

 arg1 not an integer.

Notes:

 This is kind of like the IBM/370 Test Under Mask instruction.

Examples:

 (LOGTEST 0 0)            ==> NIL
 (LOGTEST #X1 27)         ==> T
 (LOGTEST #X1 28)         ==> NIL
 (LOGTEST #b1111 #b10000) ==> NIL
 (LOGTEST #b1010 #b01001) ==> T
 (LOGTEST #xf00f00f00f00f00f00f00f00
          #x00f00f00f00f00f00f00f00f)    ==> NIL
 (LOGTEST #xf00f00f00f00f00f00f00f00
          #x00f00f00f00f00f00f00f10f)    ==> T
