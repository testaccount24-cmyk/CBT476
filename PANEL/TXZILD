%Overriding name

+You may specify a name for the ZIL function, program or module being compiled
 that differs from the name of the PDS member you are compiling.  If you leave
 this field blank, the PDS member name becomes the name of the entity being
 compiled.  The name of the load module created by the compilation process is
 the value of this field (or the PDS member name if this field is left blank).
+
%Debug? Y or N

!Y+requests that the compiler run in#"debug mode". +The output from the
 compiler will be the same, but a great deal of internal information will be
 dumped to the compilation listing.
