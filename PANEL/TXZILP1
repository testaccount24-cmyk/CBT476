 A%program+is a completely linked load module which does\not+get brought
 in under the ZIL interpreter.  Rather, it is executed as a program at
 the operating system level (e.g. in JCL via the@// EXEC+statement, or
 under TSO via the@CALL+or@EXECPGM+command).

 In order to execute a%program,+the ZIL system library must be present
 as a STEPLIB, TASKLIB or equivalent.  This library is normally
 'PROGLIB.ZIL.LOAD'.

 The ZIL interpreter and compiler are examples of ZIL%programs.+

 There cannot be a function definition with the same name as the name you are
 giving the input source program you are compiling.

%Note:+It is\not+recommended that you create ZIL%programs,+since you will not
       benefit from maintenance to ZIL system functions, and you may even end
       up with incompatible code.
