+Scrolling in ZFSEXEC is similar to scrolling in ISPF edit or browse.
 You may enter scrolling commands -%UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT+- on the ISPF command
 line, or you may press one of the following PF keys:

%           &UPX  &DOX  &LEX  &RIX
+
 The scroll amount is displayed in the upper right hand corner of the ZFSEXEC
 screen.  It applies to the%UP+and%DOWN+scrolling commands only.

 The%LEFT+and%RIGHT+scroll commands have a special meaning in ZFSEXEC.
 Pressing the%&LEF+key retrieves the previous input expression and places it on
 the input line (it also scrolls the output display to that expression).
 Each time you press the%&LEF+key, ZFSEXEC backs up one remembered input line.

 Pressing the%&RIG+key returns to the input line following the one last
 retrieved by the%&LEF+key and scrolls the output display accordingly.  If you
 haven't pressed the%&LEF+key, the%&RIG+key just positions you to the latest
 input line - a convenient way to reorient yourself after scrolling up or down.
