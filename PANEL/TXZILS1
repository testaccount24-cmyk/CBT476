  #ZIL option 3 will search your subroutine libraries for the ZIL
   interpreter, program name ZILIN.  Thus, you can run an alternate
   version of the interpreter using this facility.

  #ZIL options 4 and 5 will search your subroutine libraries at ZIL
   compilation time for any compiled functions or modules which may be
   called out by compile-time entities (macro expanders, stuff in
   (EVAL-WHEN (COMPILE) ...) forms, etc.).  It will also search there
   for the compiler, program name ZILCO.  Thus, you can run an alternate
   version of the compiler using this facility.

  #When a PROGRAM is being linkedited, the\target load library#is always
   specified as the FIRST library in the search sequence for resolving
   external references,@AHEAD#of all subroutine libraries specified.

  #The ZIL foreground options (3, 4 and 7) support the specification of
   additional subroutine libraries only if you have the!EXECPGM+TSO command
   (or an equivalent utility) available at your site.
