 This option assembles and links a ZIL function written in assembler language.

 Your source@must+reside in a partitioned data set. @Do not+enter a member name
 on the "source library name" line; enter it where it says\MEMBER NAME.+

 The\LOAD LIBRARY NAME+field contains the name of the load library into which
 the assembler function will be linked; it will have the same name as the
 member name being assembled (unless you have specified a name in the
\Overriding name+field, in which case that becomes the load module name).

 To create a load library, use the TSO ALLOCATE command or ISPF option 3.2.

 You may leave the member name field blank or specify a pattern containing an
 asterisk (*), in which case a member list will be displayed.  You can select
 members for assembly (A) or edit (E) from this member list.  Overriding names
 for the load modules can be specified by entering them in the "LOADMOD" field
 on the member list; the value in the\Overriding name+panel field is ignored.
