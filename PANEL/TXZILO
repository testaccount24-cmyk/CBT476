%SELECTION ===>_ZCMD
+

 The "dribble" facility, or session output recording, is a means of
 recording all terminal input and output during a ZIL session.

 You may select this function by entering the name of a sequential dataset or
 a SYSOUT class to hold the "dribble" output.  If &SYSTCLSH is specified,
+the output will be placed on the held queue.

 If neither is specified, no "dribbling" will take place.  This is the default.

 If a data set is specified, it may or may not currently exist; but if it
 does, it must be sequential with fixed-length 80-byte records.  The "dribble"
 file is allocated as MOD; this means that session output will be written at
 the end of any existing data.  If you wish to start a fresh "dribble" file,
 you may delete the data set beforehand, or you may use EDIT to empty it.

+You must NOT specify a partitioned data set for this function.
