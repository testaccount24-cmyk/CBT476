     This option runs a compiled LISP@program.+

     It will allocate DD names ZILI and ZILO to your terminal, and execute the
     program from the run library which you have specified, while including
     that library and the ZIL load library in the library setup for the
     duration of that call.

     If you need additional run libraries, you should preallocate them via
     the TSO@ALLOCATE+command to ddname#ZILLIB.+  However, this works only
     if the!EXECPGM+TSO command (or an equivalent utility) is available.

 The following topics will be presented only if selected by number:
