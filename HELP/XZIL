)F Function -

   This CLIST invokes the full screen interface to ZIL, an
   implementation of the LISP language developed at Draper Laboratory
   for the MVS operating system.

   Under this option, which executes as an ISPF dialog, you may run the
   ZIL interpreter or edit, compile and run LISP functions or programs,
   under the interpreter (for functions) or by themselves (for
   programs).  Compilations may be run in foreground or batch, and
   functions may be linkedited into compiled load modules.

   You may enter XZIL from READY mode or from within ISPF.

   A complete tutorial is available from the ZIL primary option menu,
   which is displayed upon entry.  If you have never used ISPF, XZIL
   will initialize your ISPF profile environment for you.

   For information on how to use ZIL, you may browse or print out the
   on-line documentation contained in 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.
