)F Function -

   This CLIST frees a ZIL output file (ZIL is an implementation
   of the LISP language developed at Draper Laboratory for the MVS
   operating system).

   Output files are referenced within ZIL by file names, which are
   atoms whose print names are 4 characters long or less.
   These correspond to MVS ddnames which are 8 characters long or
   less, which are generated by prefixing the ZIL file name with
   "ZILO".  For example:

    (PRINT 'HI 'FOO)  will print the atom "HI" on the output file
                 allocated to ddname ZILOFOO.

   Notes:

   For information on how ZIL files work, see member $FILE of the
   documentation contained in 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.

   For information on how to use ZIL, you may browse or print out the
   on-line documentation contained in 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.

   XZOFREE 'filename'

   Required - 'filename'


)O Operands -

)P'filename'

  Must be a valid ZIL file name of from 1 to 4 characters, and not
  NIL or T.  The characters "ZILO" will be appended to the beginning
  of this file name to make the MVS ddname.
