)F Function -

   This CLIST allocates a ZIL input file (ZIL is an implementation
   of the LISP language developed at Draper Laboratory for the MVS
   operating system).

   Input files are referenced within ZIL by file names, which are
   atoms whose print names are 4 characters long or less.
   These correspond to MVS ddnames which are 8 characters long or
   less, which are generated by prefixing the ZIL file name with
   "ZILI".  For example:

    (READ 'FOO)  will read an S-expression from the input file
                 allocated to ddname ZILIFOO.

   The XZIFREE CLIST will free a file allocated by this CLIST.

   Notes:

   For information on how ZIL files work, see member $FILE of the
   documentation contained in 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.

   For information on how to use ZIL, you may browse or print out the
   on-line documentation contained in 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.

)X Syntax -

   XZIFILE 'filename'
           'datasetname'
           DISPOSITION(SHR/OLD)
           REUSE

   Required - 'filename' and 'datasetname'

   Defaults:  DISPOSITION(SHR)

)O Operands -

)P'filename'

  Must be a valid ZIL file name of from 1 to 4 characters, and not
  NIL or T.  The characters "ZILI" will be appended to the beginning
  of this file name to make the MVS ddname.

  If the ddname is already allocated, this CLIST will fail unless
  the REUSE keyword is specified.

)P'datasetname'

  The name of a data set to be associated with the specified
  file name.  The data set must be an existing on-line data set.

))DISPOSITION(SHR/OLD)

  Specifies whether the data set should be allocated shared
  (SHR, the default) or exclusive (OLD).

))REUSE

  You must specify REUSE if the ddname may be already allocated
  and you want to free and reallocate it.  If you do not specify
  this parameter, the CLIST will fail if the ddname is already in use
  under your TSO session.
