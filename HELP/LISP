)F Function -

   This CLIST invokes the ZIL interpreter.  ZIL, an implementation of
   the LISP language developed at Draper Laboratory for the MVS
   operating system, allows you to execute both interpreted and
   compiled LISP functions.

   Notes:

   A full screen ISPF-based interface to ZIL is available if you
   execute the XZIL CLIST, either from READY mode or from within ISPF.

   For information on how to use ZIL, you may browse or print out the
   on-line documentation contained in 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.

   In addition, the (HELP) function invoked from within the ZIL
   interpreter displays information from the above data set.

)X Syntax -

   LISP    INITFILE ('init file dsname') / NOINITFILE
           SUBRLIB  ('load library list')
           ACSIZE   ('size of active cons space')
           CSSIZE   ('size of total cons space')
           PDSIZE   ('size of control stack')
           VSSIZE   ('size of vector/string space')
           DRIBBLE
           NEW
           OLD

   Required - none (all operands are optional)

   Note:  The defaults for ACSIZE, CSSIZE, PDSIZE and VSSIZE are the
          ZIL system defaults for these parameters, which may be found
          in member $PARM of 'PROGLIB.ZIL.TEXT'.

)O Operands -

)I LISPOPTS

))INITFILE ('source dsname')

  Optional, must be a sequential source data set or PDS member.
  Specify the name of a data set that contains your INIT file
  (which may contain your own function and macro definitions).

  If you omit this parameter, no INIT file is used.

))NOINITFILE

  If you specify NOINITFILE, no INIT file is used.

))SUBRLIB ('load library name')

  A load library with NO member name specified.  Specify the name of a
  library that contains your compiled LISP functions (you would specify
  this library as the LOAD parameter to LISPCOMP when compiling).

  If you omit SUBRLIB, you do not get any compiled functions other than
  the standard ZIL system functions, which are always present.
